The vibrant background galaxies are also brightly illuminated in this wavelength.On the other hand, MIRI data shows the young stars and star-forming regions in vibrant orange and red. Our view in the mid-infrared provides the best view of the collision point, given the noticeable gap at the top of the spiral galaxy. This collision not only began a new bout of star formation in the region, but also an endearing smile.",

They also found evidence for different cloud cover, with the morning being likely cloudier than the evening.Webb has not captured a direct image of WASP-39 b.",

The red objects are encased in thick layers of dust. Some are spiral galaxies and others are more distant galaxies that can only be detected as dots or smudges. Green galaxies are laden with dust and are farther away. Bluer galaxies are closer. Zoom in carefully to see if a blue dot has miniscule diffraction spikes — those are stars, not galaxies.",

In the Webb image, these jets are signified by bright clumpy streaks that appear red, which are shockwaves from the jet hitting surrounding gas and dust.The Serpens Nebula, located 1,300 light-years from Earth, is home to a particularly dense cluster of newly forming stars (~100,000 years old), some of which will eventually grow to the mass of our Sun.This region has been home to other coincidental discoveries, including the flapping <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2020/news-2020-22\">“Bat Shadow,”</a> which earned its name when 2020 data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope revealed a shadow from a star’s planet-forming disk to flap, or shift. This feature is visible at the center of the Webb image.To the right of the “Bat Shadow” lies another intriguing feature—an eye-shaped crevice, which appears as if a star is bursting through. However, astronomers say looks may be deceiving here. This could just be gases of different densities layered on top of one another, similar to what is seen in the famous <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-052\">Pillars of Creation</a>.And to the right of that, an extremely dark patch could be a similar occurrence. This gas and dust are so dense in comparison to the rest of the region, no near-infrared light is getting through.",

The planet is about 80% the size of Jupiter in terms of volume, but has a mass less than 10% of Jupiter, making it one of the least dense exoplanets known. &nbsp;WASP-107 b orbits its star at a distance of about 5 million miles (0.055 astronomical units, or AU), completing one circuit in 5.72 days. The planet is tidally locked: It rotates at the same rate that it orbits the star, which means that one side is permanently lit, with the other in continuous darkness, with no day-night cycle. The orbit of WASP-107 b is slightly elliptical, which means that the gravitational pull between the star and planet changes continuously as the planet moves toward and away from the star during its orbit.Observations of 0.8- to 12-micron infrared light captured by Hubble’s WFC3 (Wide Field Camera 3), and Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph), and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), suggest that the planet has a relatively large core surrounded by a relatively small mass of hydrogen and helium gas, which has been inflated due to tidal heating of the interior.WASP-107 b has not been directly imaged by any telescope.",

This phenomenon is known a <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-13e5ee83-416d-4850-889d-409022d5aa49\">secondary eclipse</a>.When the planet is next to the star, the mid-infrared light emitted by both the star and the dayside of the planet reaches the telescope, and the system appears brighter. When the planet is behind the star, the light emitted by the planet is blocked and only the starlight reaches the telescope, causing the apparent brightness to decrease.Astronomers can subtract the brightness of the star from the combined brightness of the star and planet to calculate how much infrared light is coming from the dayside of the planet. This is then used to calculate the dayside temperature and infer whether or not the planet has an atmosphere.The graph shows data collected using the low-resolution spectroscopy mode on Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument in March 2023.

The dip in the spectrum between 4 and 5 microns (NIRCam data) can be explained by absorption of those wavelengths by carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere.The spectrum was made by measuring the brightness of 4- to 5-micron light with Webb’s NIRCam GRISM spectrometer, and 5- to 12-micron with MIRI low-resolution spectrometer, before, during, and after the planet moved behind its star (the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/102/01HWQSZ6R6QHTSTE0Z0Z630R10\">secondary eclipse</a>).

In general, the hotter an object is, the more mid-infrared light it gives off.Because WASP-43 b orbits so close to its star (about 1.3 million miles, or 0.014 astronomical units), it is tidally locked: One side faces the star at all times, receiving continuous radiation, while the other faces away from the star in permanent darkness. This results in a clear temperature difference between the dayside and nightside. The amount of infrared light detected from the planet is greatest when the hot dayside faces the telescope, just before and after it passes behind the star (a phenomenon known as a secondary eclipse). The planet appears much dimmer in infrared light when the cooler nightside faces the telescope, as it moves across the star (the transit).The exact difference in temperature, however, also depends on factors such as wind speeds and cloud cover. Based on the MIRI observations, WASP-43 b has an average temperature of about 2,280°F (1,250°C) on the dayside and 1,115°F (600°C) on the nightside. This is consistent with strong winds that carry heat around from the dayside to the nightside, and the presence of nightside clouds that prevent heat energy from escaping to space.The temperature maps were made by carefully analyzing the change in temperature as different parts of the planet rotate into and out of view. The research indicates that the hottest point on the planet is not the point that receives the most light from the star (the substellar point, where the star is straight above in the sky). Instead, it is shifted about 7 degrees eastward. (This is why the maps look slightly off-center.) This is a result of strong equatorial winds, which blow at speeds upwards of 5,000 miles per hour, moving the hot air horizontally before it can radiate energy back out to space.",

Studying the galactic wind can offer insight into how the loss of gas shapes the future growth of the galaxy.This image from Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument shows M82’s galactic wind via emission from sooty chemical molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are very small dust grains that survive in cooler temperatures but are destroyed in hot conditions. The structure of the emission resembles that of hot, ionized gas, suggesting PAHs may be replenished by continued ionization of molecular gas.In this image, light at 3.35 microns is colored red, 2.50 microns is green, and 1.64 microns is blue (filters F335M, F250M, and F164N, respectively).&nbsp;",

I worked with fantastic teams filled with very talented people I knew I could rely on. We calibrated the instrument and solved a lot of problems together. Our initial analysis of the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-032\">first planet we observed with Webb</a> took only a day or two! The observatory made it very easy because it is extremely stable, but I was still shocked by the precision of Webb’s data. Now, we’re routinely seeing clear signatures of carbon dioxide and water in exoplanet atmospheres. Webb is helping us ask so many new questions about exoplanets.”Brett Graham, Senior Software Engineer at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“When Webb launched, I was impressed by the scale and goals of the mission and immediately started looking for a position at STScI. Now, I contribute to Webb by working with a team to revise software that processes Webb’s data. Our goal is for the software to quickly and efficiently pass the data along to scientists. Together, we manage a large number of complex and ever-evolving needs for calibrating and analyzing data from Webb’s instruments.

During graduate school, I used some of the biggest telescopes on the planet—and in space—to catch their faint light. In 2022, I began using this telescope—and its data are absolutely exquisite! Now, I can look at star formation happening inside galaxies and investigate how stars’ radiation impacts the gas. I have dreamed of researching <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--introduction\">spectroscopic data</a> like these for years and I sometimes still pinch myself to make sure this is real.

Our team’s goal is to highlight the complex structures of objects in space while simultaneously making aesthetically pleasing images. Raw telescope images initially appear black and white. When I add color, I follow well-established principles of <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made\">astrophotography</a>, assigning bluer colors to shorter wavelengths and redder colors to longer wavelengths. From there, the science informs our team’s decisions about contrast, color separation, and composition. My hope is that Webb’s images generate interest in astronomy and connect us all.”Jane Rigby, Senior Project Scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:“Webb has exceeded every one of our expectations. For example, Webb observed galaxies that existed in the early universe in just a couple of hours. We knew Webb was going to do that, but we didn’t project it could between lunch and dinner! This is possible because Webb is supported by hundreds of people in a wide range of roles. Teamwork helped us build, test, and commission Webb—and continues to keep it operating around the clock. Science has always been collaborative, but it’s easier to see now. We all have a place in astronomy and STEM fields. My advice: No matter what your passion is, go for it. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t. When you’re puzzling through problem sets with other students, that’s good practice—you will work with teams throughout your career.”Naomi Rowe-Gurney, recent Postdoctoral Researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and current Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Support Officer at the Royal Astronomical Society in London:“While at NASA, I supported researchers who study <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-01e137c1-9995-4074-9063-0ee5d91af357\">our solar system’s</a> planets and moons.

I am lucky that Webb’s operations reasonably match my career. In 2023, I published a paper as the lead author for the first time in years. Know that there is room for everybody in science, no matter which avenue you pursue. Passion is important. Wherever you go you will encounter difficulties, and passion will help you overcome them.”Aaron Yung, recent NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and current Giacconi Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“A few centuries back, important scientific discoveries were predominantly made by individual researchers using artisanal instruments. In contrast, modern-day instruments, like the James Webb Space Telescope, are highly sophisticated and demand the combined efforts of large groups of scientists and engineers. These collaborations have allowed me to learn from others who often possess entirely different scientific backgrounds. We work better as a supportive, interconnected team!”Sebastian Zieba, PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany:“We are privileged to be among the first generations of humans to know that there are planets orbiting other stars. Webb is already advancing our understanding of <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-ac669373-3069-4851-858a-5d378cf1fb8d\">rocky exoplanet</a> <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-e7f9c51f-3c43-458e-8017-f081dbf14642\">atmospheres</a> and surfaces. In 2022, I was part of a team that managed to detect heat coming from <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-125\">TRAPPIST-1 c</a>, a planet the size of Earth that is 40 light-years away. I am also excited about the chance to study the surfaces of planets that are bare rocks. When a planet doesn’t have an atmosphere, we can directly observe its surface. Different types of rocks have unique characteristics that can tell us about a planet’s geological history. Webb is a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity, and gives us a remarkable ability to explore the entire cosmos.”<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/about/people-behind-webb\">Read longer quotes from these contributors.</a>",

I am lucky that Webb’s operations reasonably match my career. In 2023, I published a paper as the lead author for the first time in years. Know that there is room for everybody in science, no matter which avenue you pursue. Passion is important. Wherever you go you will encounter difficulties, and passion will help you overcome them.”Aaron Yung, recent NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and current Giacconi Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“A few centuries back, important scientific discoveries were predominantly made by individual researchers using artisanal instruments. In contrast, modern-day instruments, like the James Webb Space Telescope, are highly sophisticated and demand the combined efforts of large groups of scientists and engineers. These collaborations have allowed me to learn from others who often possess entirely different scientific backgrounds. We work better as a supportive, interconnected team!”Sebastian Zieba, PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany:“We are privileged to be among the first generations of humans to know that there are planets orbiting other stars. Webb is already advancing our understanding of <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-ac669373-3069-4851-858a-5d378cf1fb8d\">rocky exoplanet</a> <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-e7f9c51f-3c43-458e-8017-f081dbf14642\">atmospheres</a> and surfaces. In 2022, I was part of a team that managed to detect heat coming from <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-125\">TRAPPIST-1 c</a>, a planet the size of Earth that is 40 light-years away. I am also excited about the chance to study the surfaces of planets that are bare rocks. When a planet doesn’t have an atmosphere, we can directly observe its surface. Different types of rocks have unique characteristics that can tell us about a planet’s geological history. Webb is a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity, and gives us a remarkable ability to explore the entire cosmos.”<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/about/people-behind-webb\">Read longer quotes from these contributors.</a>",

Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.”Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\">NIRCam</a> (Near-Infrared Camera) captured millions of stars in these images. Older stars appear blue here, and are clustered at the galaxies’ cores.&nbsp;The telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\">MIRI</a> (Mid-Infrared Instrument) observations highlight glowing dust, showing where it exists around and between stars – appearing in shades of red and orange. Stars that haven’t yet fully formed and are encased in gas and dust appear bright red.Webb’s high-resolution images are the first to show large, spherical shells in the gas and dust in such exquisite detail. These holes may have been created by stars that exploded and carved out giant regions in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-5e7e2388-0eae-4a31-96f7-ad1f8419c9eb\">interstellar material.</a>Another eye-catching detail? Several galaxy cores are awash in pink-and-red diffraction spikes. These are clear signs that these galaxies may have central active supermassive black holes or central star clusters.These spiral galaxies are Webb’s first big batch of contributions to the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, that includes existing images and data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope’s Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1566 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1566 is 60 million light-years away in the constellation Dorado.",

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb’s image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 2835 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 2835 is 35 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.",

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 3351 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 3351 is 33 million light-years away in the constellation Leo.",

      "caption": "Face-on spiral galaxy, NGC 3351, is split diagonally in this image: The James Webb Space Telescope’s observations appear on bottom right, and the Hubble Space Telescope’s at top left. Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 3351 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 3351 is 33 million light-years away in the constellation Leo.",

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer.

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 4321 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 4321 is 55 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices.",

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 5068 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 5068 is 20 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.",

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy NGC 7496 above. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 7496 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 7496 is 24 million light-years away in the constellation Grus.",

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere.

These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1385 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1385 is 30 million light-years away in the constellation Fornax.",

Webb’s observations combine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1512 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1512 is 30 million light-years away in the constellation Horologium.",

(They did not classify each galaxy’s individual appearance since that would require detailed information from data known as <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--types-of-spectra-and-spectroscopy\">spectra</a>.)They found an array of odd shapes when the universe was 600 million to 6 billion years old. The galaxy shapes that dominate look flat and elongated, like pool noodles or surfboards. These two galaxy types make up approximately 50 to 80% of all the distant galaxies they studied – a surprise, since these shapes are rare closer to home.Other galaxies Webb detected appear round but also flattened, like frisbees. The least populated category is made up of galaxies that are shaped like spheres or volleyballs.Webb’s data also resolved a riddle that was introduced by the Hubble Space Telescope’s observations decades ago. Why do so many distant galaxies appear like long lines? Was there more to the galaxies that didn’t appear in its images? Webb answered this in short order: Hubble hasn’t missed anything.“Webb confirmed what Hubble has long shown us, but in greater detail in infrared light,” Pandya said. “Their combined observations show that in the early universe, many more galaxies appear flat and elongated. This has profound implications, since we usually assume that galaxies like our own Milky Way started out as disks, but that may not be the case.”Why do galaxies have such different shapes early in the history of the universe? This question remains unanswered for now, but research is underway to better understand <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-did-the-young-universe-look-like\">how galaxies evolved over all of cosmic time</a>.See more <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/104/01HHZ8N8Z8Q24M8Z1KEK9TDTHC\">galaxy samples</a> from Webb’s CEERS Survey and more concretely <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/104/01HHZE0D278BBH24A0YDY7ESQ3\">compare their 3D shapes</a>.",

Uranus’ dim inner and outer rings are also visible in this image, including the elusive Zeta ring—the extremely faint and diffuse ring closest to the planet.This Webb image also shows 9 of the planet’s 27 moons. They are the blue dots that surround the planet’s rings. Clockwise starting at 2 o’clock, they are: Rosalind, Puck, Belinda, Desdemona, Cressida, Bianca, Portia, Juliet, and Perdita. The orbits of these moons share the 98-degree tilt of their parent planet relative to the plane of the solar system.One day on Uranus is about 17 hours, so the planet’s rotation is relatively quick. This makes it supremely difficult for observatories with a sharp eye like Webb to capture one simple image of the entire planet – storms and other atmospheric features, and the planet’s moons, move visibly within minutes. This image combines several longer and shorter exposures of this dynamic system to correct for those slight changes throughout the observing time.",

However, when Webb followed up on SZ Cha in 2023, the ratio of neon II to III was within typical levels.All of this is significant because protoplanetary disks are the stuff of future planetary systems – and those potential planets are in a race against time.

At a wavelength of 2.12 microns, which observes between altitudes of about 12-21 miles (20-35 kilometers) above Jupiter’s cloud tops, researchers spotted several wind shears, or areas where wind speeds change with height or with distance, which enabled them to track the jet. This image highlights several of the features around Jupiter’s equatorial zone that, between one rotation of the planet (10 hours), are very clearly disturbed by the motion of the jet stream.",

The black hole, within galaxy CEERS 1019, existed just over 570 million years after the big bang and weighs only 9 million solar masses. For context, the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy is 4.6 million times the mass of the Sun, and other very distant supermassive black holes we’ve known about for decades weigh more than 1 billion times the mass of the Sun. (CEERS 1019 may only hold this record for a few weeks – claims about other, more distant black holes identified by Webb are currently being carefully reviewed by the astronomical community.)Though small, CEERS 1019 is ravenous, consuming gas, dust, and stars at the highest theoretically possible rate for its size.

Three were recently identified by in the James Webb Space Telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-114\">Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey</a>.The most distant black hole is CEERS 1019, which existed just over 570 million years after the big bang. CEERS 746 was detected 1 billion years after the big bang. Third place currently goes to CEERS 2782, which existed 1.1 billion years after the big bang.Knowing they existed is important, but more fully understanding their compositions may ultimately lead us to revise what we know about black holes that existed when the universe was very young. The new CEERS black holes are much smaller than any others researchers have detected. CEERS 1019 weighs only 9 million solar masses. Both CEERS 746 and CEERS 2782 are slightly larger, weighing in at 10 million times the mass of the Sun. All three are more similar to the mass of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, which is only 4.6 million times the mass of the Sun, than to other distant behemoths in the early universe we’ve known about previously, which tend to weigh over 1 billion times the mass of the Sun.The CEERS “light weights” may help completely reshape what we understand about how supermassive black holes formed and grew during the universe’s first billion years. This is critical because the universe was cast in a dense “fog” during this period, known as the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2020/37/4697-Image\">Era of Reionization</a>. How did these black holes form in the first place? After they formed, did these black holes help charge or ionize the gas particles, leading to more transparent conditions around their host galaxies?Researchers certainly need to identify and classify many more extremely distant black holes to begin answering these big questions. This might be as few as a dozen sources, if they all follow the same trend, or upward of 50. In the coming years, Webb’s highly detailed images and data will help astronomers build larger and larger samples of the masses of black hole across cosmic time, and begin to better model how they developed over billions of years. “The more black holes we find, and the earlier we find them, the easier it will be able to put constraints on how they formed and evolved over billions of years,” explained Steven Finkelstein of the University of Texas at Austin, who leads the CEERS Survey.",

The large amounts of dust found around these supernovae support the theory that supernovae played a key role in supplying dust to the early universe.SN 2004et is highlighted in the left panel of this image, and SN 2017eaw in the right panel.

In these images, the bluer colors indicate hotter dust, while red is cooler dust. The hexagonal shape of SN 2004et in Webb’s image is an artifact of the telescope’s mirror and struts — when the bright light of a point source is observed, the light interacts with the sharp edges of the telescope, creating diffraction spikes.The new Webb discovery is the first breakthrough in the study of dust production from supernovae since the detection of newly formed dust in relatively nearby (170,000 light-years) Supernova 1987A.In SN 2004et, researchers using Webb found more than 5,000 Earth masses of dust, rivaling the amount of dust found in SN 1987A. That’s why SN 2004et appears brighter and redder in Webb images. SN 2017eaw is currently hotter, with less dust (bluer in Webb observations), but in 13 years, researchers expect it to appear similar to how SN 2004et does now.In these images, blue, green, and red were assigned to Webb’s MIRI data at 10; 11.3, 12.8, and 15.0; and 18 and 21 microns (F1000W; F1130W, F1280W, and F1500W; and F1800W and F2100W, respectively).<em>MIRI was contributed by NASA and ESA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in partnership with the University of Arizona.</em>",

When the planet is beside the star, the light emitted by both the star and the dayside of the planet reach the telescope, and the system appears brighter. When the planet is behind the star, the light emitted by the planet is blocked and only the starlight reaches the telescope, causing the apparent brightness to decrease.Astronomers can subtract the brightness of the star from the combined brightness of the star and planet to calculate how much infrared light is coming from the planet’s dayside. This is then used to calculate the dayside temperature and infer the presence and possible composition of the atmosphere.The graph shows combined data from four separate observations made using MIRI’s F1500W filter, which only allows light with wavelengths ranging from about 13.5 - 16.7 microns to pass through to the detectors. The blue squares are individual brightness measurements. The red circles show measurements that are “binned,” or averaged to make it easier to see the change over time. The white line is the best fit, or model light curve that matches the data most closely. The decrease in brightness during the secondary eclipse is less than 0.05%.The temperature calculated from this observation is 380 +/- 31 kelvins (between 170 and 280 degrees Fahrenheit). TRAPPIST-1 c is the coolest rocky exoplanet ever observed using secondary eclipse photometry.",

This makes them the earliest galaxies yet to be spectroscopically confirmed as part of a developing cluster.&nbsp;Astronomers used the telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0T08S2V810Y7ENZMGWTVDA\">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> (NIRSpec) instrument to precisely measure the distances and determine that the galaxies are part of a developing cluster. Galaxy YD4, previously estimated to be at a further distance based on imaging data alone, was able to be more accurately placed at the same redshift as the other galaxies. Before Webb, astronomers did not have high resolution imaging or spectral infrared data available to do this type of science.&nbsp;At extreme distances, astronomers use the redshift reference to account for the fact that, as the universe expands, wavelengths of light are stretched and “shifted” to redder wavelengths, which are longer. Shorter wavelengths, for example ultraviolet and X-ray, are toward the bluer end of the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\" target=\"_self\">electromagnetic spectrum</a>.

The temperature of the dayside of Mercury is also shown for reference.&nbsp;The dayside brightness of TRAPPIST-1 b at 15 microns corresponds to a temperature of about 500 kelvins (roughly 450 degrees Fahrenheit). This is consistent with the temperature assuming the planet is tidally locked (one side facing the star at all times), with a dark-colored surface, no atmosphere, and no redistribution of heat from the dayside to the nightside.&nbsp;If the heat energy from the star were distributed evenly around the planet (for example, by a circulating carbon dioxide-free atmosphere), the temperature at 15 microns would be 400 kelvins (260 degrees Fahrenheit). If the atmosphere had a substantial amount of carbon dioxide, it would emit even less 15-micron light and would appear to be even cooler.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although TRAPPIST-1 b is hot by Earth standards, it is cooler than the dayside of Mercury, which consists of bare rock and no significant atmosphere.

They plotted the light on the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--introduction\" target=\"_self\">spectrum</a> above.First, let’s look for silicate clouds in Webb’s data. Based on observations of many other exoplanets by many telescopes, the researchers know to look for signatures of clouds in particular areas in the spectrum. Signatures of silicates appears before and after 10 microns, a particular wavelength of infrared light.There is likely a layer of very small grain silicate clouds higher up in the atmosphere. These silicates are finer, more like smoke particles, and are responsible for creating the plateau near 10 microns. Somewhat larger grain clouds are likely a bit deeper. Some particles in these clouds may be about the size of small grains of silt.The combined evidence of fluctuations in the planet’s brightness over time and the different cloud layers in the spectrum point to turbulent weather on VHS 1256 b. “These detections reflect that the planet’s cloud patterns change fairly rapidly,” explained Beth Biller of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. If the researchers were to take more, and longer, observations of the planet, they would see the spectrum shape shift as the locations of the clouds move, reflecting that the clouds are rapidly shifting through the planet’s atmosphere during its 22-hour rotation.But these aren’t like clouds high in Earth’s atmosphere. These clouds are hot – akin to the temperature of a candle flame. Earth’s upper atmosphere is thin and would feel extremely cold.The researchers also made extraordinarily clear detections of water, methane and carbon monoxide with Webb, and found evidence of carbon dioxide. It’s too early to tell what this combination of molecules might mean, though, since the data need to be fully modeled. “Webb’s high-resolution data are stressing our existing models,” notes Polychronis Patapis of ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “Existing models can ingest one or two features, but not as many as Webb has shown us of this target.” This is an extraordinarily exciting moment for researchers – it means there is an amazing amount to learn as they revamp models to fit these data.Webb’s observations of VHS 1256 b highlight many of its technical strengths. Not only do its instruments detect a wide range of near- and mid-infrared light, Webb’s position in space means that the telescope can observe more infrared light than is accessible on Earth – and it captures the details in high resolution. (Earth’s atmosphere filters out some near-infrared and all mid-infrared light.) “Webb has effectively doubled the wavelength range that we’re able to capture,” said Brittany Miles of the University of Arizona, the paper’s lead author. “To top that off, we only needed seven hours to capture the spectrum, which is practically overflowing with details.”VHS 1256 b is about 40 light-years away in the constellation Corvus. It orbits not one, but two stars, which are tightly orbiting one another. The planet lies about four times farther from its stars than Pluto is from our Sun. Although a single day on this planet is 22 hours long, it takes 10,000 years to complete a single orbit or year.The planet’s clouds were confirmed with data from the Webb Telescope.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em><em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

It’s too early to tell what this combination of molecules might mean, though, since the data need to be fully modeled. “Webb’s high-resolution data are stressing our existing models,” notes Polychronis Patapis of ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “Existing models can ingest one or two features, but not as many as Webb has shown us of this target.” This is an extraordinarily exciting moment for researchers – it means there is an amazing amount to learn as they revamp models to fit these data.Webb’s observations of VHS 1256 b highlight many of its technical strengths. Not only do its instruments detect a wide range of near- and mid-infrared light, Webb’s position in space means that the telescope can observe more infrared light than is accessible on Earth – and it captures the details in high resolution. (Earth’s atmosphere filters out some near-infrared and all mid-infrared light.) “Webb has effectively doubled the wavelength range that we’re able to capture,” said Brittany Miles of the University of Arizona, the paper’s lead author. “To top that off, we only needed seven hours to capture the spectrum, which is practically overflowing with details.”VHS 1256 b is about 40 light-years away in the constellation Corvus. It orbits not one, but two stars, which are tightly orbiting one another. The planet lies about four times farther from its stars than Pluto is from our Sun. Although a single day on this planet is 22 hours long, it takes 10,000 years to complete a single orbit or year.The planet’s clouds were confirmed with data from the Webb Telescope.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em><em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

Their light has travelled through varying distances to reach the telescope’s detectors, representing the vastness of space in a single image. A foreground star in our own galaxy, to the right of the image center, displays Webb’s distinctive diffraction spikes. Bright white sources surrounded by a hazy glow are the galaxies of Pandora’s Cluster, a conglomeration of already-massive clusters of galaxies coming together to form a megacluster. The concentration of mass is so great that the fabric of spacetime is warped by gravity, creating an effect that makes the region of special interest to astronomers: a natural, super-magnifying glass called a “gravitational lens” that they can use to see very distant sources of light beyond the cluster that would otherwise be undetectable, even to Webb.&nbsp;These lensed sources appear red in the image, and often as elongated arcs distorted by the gravitational lens. Many of these are galaxies from the early universe, with their contents magnified and stretched out for astronomers to study. Other red sources in the image have yet to be confirmed by follow-up observations with Webb’s Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument to determine their true nature.

Researchers will follow up this summer with another observation with Webb, which they hope will allow them to definitively conclude if the planet has an atmosphere.LHS 475 b is relatively close, 41 light-years away, in the constellation Octans.This illustration is based on observations from Webb.

As this spectrum shows, Webb did not observe a detectable quantity of any element or molecule. Common signatures in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, for example, would indicate a light, gaseous atmosphere. Those elements were not detected in LHS 475 b’s spectrum.The green line represents a pure methane atmosphere, which is not favored since if methane were present, it would be expected to block more starlight at 3.3 microns. The yellow line represents the best-fit model for a featureless spectrum that contains no evidence of the planet’s atmosphere. This model is representative of a planet that has no atmosphere.The purple line represents a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere and is indistinguishable from a flat line at the current level of precision. An atmosphere made up of pure carbon dioxide is far more difficult to detect, even for Webb’s advanced instruments. “We require very, very precise data to be able to distinguish a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere from no atmosphere at all,” explained Jacob Lustig-Yaeger of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. “A pure carbon dioxide atmosphere may be thin like the one on <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars</a>, making it difficult to detect.”The researchers studying LHS 475 b suggest that an additional, upcoming observation may act as a “tie breaker,” allowing them to identify any presence of carbon dioxide – or any other molecule – or rule everything out and conclude the planet has no atmosphere. Quite simply, additional data are required before a conclusion can be made.This transmission spectrum of the rocky exoplanet LHS 475 b was captured by Webb’s NIRSpec instrument on August 31, 2022. A transmission spectrum is made by comparing starlight filtered through a planet’s atmosphere as it moves in front of the star to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star. Each of the 56 data points on this graph represents the amount of light that the planet blocks from the star at a different wavelength of light. The data would reveal molecules in the planet’s atmosphere by showing that they increase the apparent size of the planet at only specific wavelengths. No such atmospheric features are observed in this spectrum.The gray lines extending above and below each data point are error bars that show the uncertainty of each measurement, or the reasonable range of actual possible values.

      "caption": "A flat line in a transmission spectrum, like this one, can be exciting – it can tell us <em>a lot</em> about the planet.Researchers used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0T08S2V810Y7ENZMGWTVDA\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> (NIRSpec) to observe exoplanet LHS 475 b. As this spectrum shows, Webb did not observe a detectable quantity of any element or molecule. Common signatures in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, for example, would indicate a light, gaseous atmosphere. Those elements were not detected in LHS 475 b’s spectrum.The green line represents a pure methane atmosphere, which is not favored since if methane were present, it would be expected to block more starlight at 3.3 microns. The yellow line represents the best-fit model for a featureless spectrum that contains no evidence of the planet’s atmosphere. This model is representative of a planet that has no atmosphere.The purple line represents a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere and is indistinguishable from a flat line at the current level of precision. An atmosphere made up of pure carbon dioxide is far more difficult to detect, even for Webb’s advanced instruments. “We require very, very precise data to be able to distinguish a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere from no atmosphere at all,” explained Jacob Lustig-Yaeger of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. “A pure carbon dioxide atmosphere may be thin like the one on <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars</a>, making it difficult to detect.”The researchers studying LHS 475 b suggest that an additional, upcoming observation may act as a “tie breaker,” allowing them to identify any presence of carbon dioxide – or any other molecule – or rule everything out and conclude the planet has no atmosphere. Quite simply, additional data are required before a conclusion can be made.This transmission spectrum of the rocky exoplanet LHS 475 b was captured by Webb’s NIRSpec instrument on August 31, 2022. A transmission spectrum is made by comparing starlight filtered through a planet’s atmosphere as it moves in front of the star to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star. Each of the 56 data points on this graph represents the amount of light that the planet blocks from the star at a different wavelength of light. The data would reveal molecules in the planet’s atmosphere by showing that they increase the apparent size of the planet at only specific wavelengths. No such atmospheric features are observed in this spectrum.The gray lines extending above and below each data point are error bars that show the uncertainty of each measurement, or the reasonable range of actual possible values. For a single observation, the error on these measurements is extremely small (30 to 50 parts per million).The observation was made using the NIRSpec bright object time-series mode, which uses a grating to spread out light from a single bright object (like the star LHS 475) and measure the brightness of each wavelength at set intervals of time.LHS 475 b is a rocky exoplanet approximately that same size as Earth. It orbits a <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-90e3c863-5675-4518-9680-4f1ed865d62a\" target=\"_self\">red dwarf star</a> roughly 41 light-years away in the constellation Octans. The planet orbits extremely close to its star and completes one orbit in two Earth-days. The planet’s discovery was confirmed with data from the Webb Telescope.The background illustration of LHS 475 b and its star is based on current understanding of the planet from Webb spectroscopy. Webb has not captured a direct image of the planet or its atmosphere.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

It orbits star 1 far more tightly than star 2 does.Cue the action! The second panel zooms way in on the scene – and two other companions appear in view. Star 1 has begun to swell as it ages rapidly, swallowing star 3. Through gravity, star 3 starts to draw in material from star 1 and launches jets in both directions. Star 4 is close by, but not yet interacting.The third panel shows how much star 1 has expanded as it ages. Two companions also enter the mix. Stars 3 and 4 have sent off a series of bipolar jets.

Near-infrared light also reveals thousands of newly formed stars – look for bright orange spheres that lie just outside the dusty pillars.In mid-infrared light, the dust is on full display. The contributions from Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) are most apparent in the layers of diffuse, orange dust that drape the top of the image, relaxing into a V. The densest regions of dust are cast in deep indigo hues, obscuring our view of the activities inside the dense pillars.Dust also makes up the spire-like pillars that extend from the bottom left to the top right. This is one of the reasons why the region is overflowing with stars – dust is a major ingredient of star formation. When knots of gas and dust with sufficient mass form in the pillars, they begin to collapse under their own gravitational attraction, slowly heat up, and eventually form new stars. Newly formed stars are especially apparent at the edges of the top two pillars – they are practically bursting onto the scene.At the top edge of the second pillar, undulating detail in red hints at even more embedded stars. These are even younger, and are quite active as they form. The lava-like regions capture their periodic ejections. As stars form, they periodically send out supersonic jets that can interact within clouds of material, like these thick pillars of gas and dust. These young stars are estimated to be only a few hundred thousand years old, and will continue to form for millions of years.Almost everything you see in this scene is local. The distant universe is largely blocked from our view both by the interstellar medium, which is made up of sparse gas and dust located between the stars, and a thick dust lane in our Milky Way galaxy.

Researchers can vary the parameters in the model – changing unknown characteristics like cloud height in the atmosphere and abundances of various gases – to get a better fit and further understand what the atmosphere is really like.At upper left, data from NIRISS shows fingerprints of potassium (K), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and carbon monoxide (CO). At upper right, data from NIRCam shows a prominent water signature. At lower left, data from NIRSpec indicates water, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO). At lower right, additional NIRSpec data reveals all of these molecules as well as sodium (Na).",

Many stars are actively forming in these dense blue-gray pillars.

Stars typically do not emit much mid-infrared light. Instead, they are easiest to detect in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. In this MIRI view, two types of stars can be identified. The stars at the end of the thick, dusty pillars have recently eroded the material surrounding them. They show up in red because their atmospheres are still enshrouded in cloaks of dust. In contrast, blue tones indicate stars that are older and have shed most of their gas and dust.Mid-infrared light also details dense regions of gas and dust. The red region toward the top, which forms a delicate V shape, is where the dust is both diffuse and cooler. And although it may seem like the scene clears toward the bottom left of this view, the darkest gray areas are where densest and coolest regions of dust lie. Notice that there are many fewer stars and no background galaxies popping into view.Webb’s mid-infrared data will help researchers determine exactly how much dust is in this region – and what it’s made of.

It lies within the Eagle Nebula, which is also known as Messier 16 (M16).The north and east compass arrows show the orientation of the image on the sky. Note that the relationship between north and east on the sky (as seen from below) is flipped relative to direction arrows on a map of the ground (as seen from above).The scale bar is labeled in light-years, which is the distance that light travels in one Earth-year. (It takes 2 years for light to travel a distance equal to the length of the scale bar.) One light-year is equal to about 5.88 trillion miles or 9.46 trillion kilometers. The field of view shown in this image is approximately 8 light-years across.This image shows near-infrared wavelengths of light that have been translated into visible-light colors. The color key shows which NIRCam filters were used when collecting the light. The color of each filter name is the visible light color used to represent the infrared light that passes through that filter.<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/052/01GF423GBQSK6ANC89NTFJW8VM\" target=\"_self\">Read a full description of the image.</a>",

Hubble will monitor Dimorphos ten more times over the next three weeks to monitor how the ejecta cloud expands and fades over time.Hubble observations were conducted in one filter, WFC3/UVIS F350LP (assigned the color blue), while Webb observed at F070W (0.7 microns, assigned the color red).<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em>",

Other details, like the broad shape of the spectrum and the slope of the curve at different points, reveal information about dust, clouds, and surface features.&nbsp;The data were collected using six different high-resolution spectroscopy modes (grating modes), each of which covers a different wavelength range. (The white line is not continuous because there are small gaps in coverage.) The best-fit model takes into account the data as well as other known properties of Mars. Constructing a best-fit model using a tool such as the Planetary Spectrum Generator makes it possible to estimate abundances of given molecules in the atmosphere.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>See the Fast Facts below for additional technical details.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/early-highlights/mars-is-mighty-in-first-webb-observations-of-red-planet.html\" target=\"_self\">Read the story</a>",

A <a href=\"https://viewspace.org/interactives/unveiling_invisible_universe/detecting_other_worlds/transiting_exoplanet\" target=\"_self\">transit</a> occurs when an orbiting planet moves between the star and the telescope, blocking some of the light from the star.&nbsp;This observation was made using the NIRSpec PRISM bright object time-series mode, which involves using a prism to spread out light from a single bright object (like the star WASP-39) and measure the brightness of each wavelength at set intervals of time.To capture these data, Webb stared at the WASP-39 star system for more than eight hours, beginning about three hours before the transit and ending about two hours after the transit was complete. The transit itself lasted about three hours. Each curve shown here includes a total of 500 individual brightness measurements – about one per minute.Although all colors are blocked to some extent by the planet, some colors are blocked more than others. This occurs because each gas in the atmosphere absorbs different amounts of specific wavelengths. As a result, each color has a slightly different light curve.

A <a href=\"https://viewspace.org/interactives/unveiling_invisible_universe/detecting_other_worlds/transiting_exoplanet\" target=\"_self\">transit</a> occurs when an orbiting planet moves between the star and the telescope, blocking some of the light from the star.&nbsp;This observation was made using the NIRSpec PRISM bright object time-series mode, which involves using a prism to spread out light from a single bright object (like the star WASP-39) and measure the brightness of each wavelength at set intervals of time.To capture these data, Webb stared at the WASP-39 star system for more than eight hours, beginning about three hours before the transit and ending about two hours after the transit was complete. The transit itself lasted about three hours. Each curve shown here includes a total of 500 individual brightness measurements – about one per minute.Although all colors are blocked to some extent by the planet, some colors are blocked more than others. This occurs because each gas in the atmosphere absorbs different amounts of specific wavelengths. As a result, each color has a slightly different light curve. During the transit of WASP-39 b, light with a wavelength of 4.3 microns is not as bright as 3.0-micron or 4.7-micron light because it is absorbed by carbon dioxide.WASP-39 b is a hot gas giant exoplanet that orbits a Sun-like star roughly 700 light-years away, in the constellation Virgo. The planet orbits extremely close to its star (less than 1/20th the distance between Earth and the Sun) and completes one orbit in just over 4 Earth-days. The star, WASP-39, is roughly the same size, mass, temperature, and color as the Sun. The planet’s discovery, from ground-based observations, was announced in 2011.&nbsp;The background illustration of WASP-39 b and its star is based on current understanding of the planet from Webb spectroscopy and previous ground- and space-based observations. Webb has not captured a direct image of the planet or its atmosphere.",

      "caption": "Astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope combined the capabilities of the telescope’s two cameras to create a never-before-seen view of a star-forming region in the Carina Nebula. Captured in <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\" target=\"_self\">infrared light</a> by the Near-Infrared Camera (<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\" target=\"_self\">NIRCam</a>) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">MIRI</a>), this combined image reveals previously invisible areas of star birth.&nbsp;What looks much like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region known as NGC 3324. Called the Cosmic Cliffs, this rim of a gigantic, gaseous cavity is roughly 7,600 light-years away.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image. The high-energy radiation from these stars is sculpting the nebula’s wall by slowly eroding it away.&nbsp;NIRCam – with its crisp resolution and unparalleled sensitivity – unveils hundreds of previously hidden stars, and even numerous background galaxies. In MIRI’s view, young stars and their dusty, <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/videos/01G6X2C9R0TPVCHXSRBCEVNW03\" target=\"_self\">planet-forming disks</a> shine brightly in the mid-infrared, appearing pink and red. MIRI reveals structures that are embedded in the dust and uncovers the stellar sources of massive jets and outflows. With MIRI, the hydrocarbons and other chemical compounds on the surface of the ridges glow, giving the appearance of jagged rocks.Several prominent features in this image are described below.This period of very early star formation is difficult to capture because, for an individual star, it lasts only about 50,000 to 100,000 years – but Webb’s extreme sensitivity and exquisite spatial resolution have chronicled this rare event.&nbsp;NGC 3324 was first catalogued by James Dunlop in 1826. Visible from the Southern Hemisphere, it is located at the northwest corner of the Carina Nebula (NGC 3372), which resides in the constellation Carina. The Carina Nebula is home to the Keyhole Nebula and the active, unstable supergiant star called Eta Carinae.&nbsp;<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>&nbsp;",

Most dramatically, Webb’s MIRI instrument captures huge shock waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashes through the cluster. These regions surrounding the central pair of galaxies are shown in the colors red and gold.This composite NIRCam-MIRI image uses two of the three MIRI filters to best show and differentiate the hot dust and structure within the galaxy. MIRI sees a distinct difference in color between the dust in the galaxies versus the shock waves between the interacting galaxies. The image processing specialists at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore opted to highlight that difference by giving MIRI data the distinct yellow and orange colors, in contrast to the blue and white colors assigned to stars at NIRCam’s wavelengths.&nbsp;Together, the five galaxies of Stephan’s Quintet are also known as the Hickson Compact Group 92 (HCG 92). Although called a “quintet,” only four of the galaxies are truly close together and caught up in a cosmic dance. The fifth and leftmost galaxy, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four. NGC 7320 resides 40 million light-years from Earth, while the other four galaxies (NGC 7317, NGC 7318A, NGC 7318B, and NGC 7319) are about 290 million light-years away. This is still fairly close in cosmic terms, compared with more distant galaxies billions of light-years away. Studying these relatively nearby galaxies helps scientists better understand structures seen in a much more distant universe.This proximity provides astronomers a ringside seat for witnessing the merging of and interactions between galaxies that are so crucial to all of galaxy evolution. Rarely do scientists see in so much exquisite detail how interacting galaxies trigger star formation in each other, and how the gas in these galaxies is being disturbed. Stephan’s Quintet is a fantastic “laboratory” for studying these processes fundamental to all galaxies.Tight groups like this may have been more common in the early universe when their superheated, infalling material may have fueled very energetic black holes called quasars.

Although called a “quintet,” only four of the galaxies are truly close together and caught up in a cosmic dance. The fifth and leftmost galaxy, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four.&nbsp;Tight groups like this may have been more common in the early universe when their superheated, infalling material may have fueled very energetic black holes called quasars. Even today, the topmost galaxy in the group – NGC 7319 – harbors an <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei\" target=\"_self\">active galactic nucleus</a>, a supermassive black hole 24 million times the mass of the Sun. It is actively pulling in material and puts out light energy equivalent to 40 billion Suns.&nbsp;Scientists using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope studied the active galactic nucleus in great detail with the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) that is part of the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)</a>.

These IFUs provided the Webb team with a “data cube,” or collection of images of the galactic core’s spectral features.&nbsp;Using IFUs, scientists can measure spatial structures, determine the velocity of those structures, and get a full range of spectral data. Much like medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the IFUs allow scientists to “slice and dice” the information into many images for detailed study.&nbsp;MIRI’s MRS pierced through the shroud of dust near the active galactic nucleus to measure the bright emission from nearby hot gas that is being ionized by powerful winds and radiation from the black hole. The instrument saw the gas near the supermassive black hole at a level of detail never seen before, and it was able to determine its composition.&nbsp;When a supermassive black hole feeds, some of the infalling material becomes very hot and is pushed away from the black hole in the form of winds and jets. MIRI probed many different regions, including the black hole’s outflowing wind – indicated by the smaller circle – and the area immediately around the black hole itself – indicated by the larger circle. It showed that the black hole is enshrouded in silicate dust similar to beach sand, but with much smaller grains.&nbsp;&nbsp;The top spectrum, from the black hole’s outflow, shows a region filled with hot, ionized gases, including iron, argon, neon, sulfur and oxygen as denoted by the peaks at given wavelengths. The presence of multiple emission lines from the same element with different degrees of ionization is valuable for understanding the properties and origins of the outflow.&nbsp;The bottom spectrum reveals that the supermassive black hole has a reservoir of colder, denser gas with large quantities of molecular hydrogen and silicate dust that absorb the light from the central regions of the galaxy.&nbsp;<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>&nbsp;",

Although called a “quintet,” only four of the galaxies are truly close together and caught up in a cosmic dance. The fifth and leftmost galaxy, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four.&nbsp;Tight groups like this may have been more common in the early universe when their superheated, infalling material may have fueled very energetic black holes called quasars.

Those outer layers now form the ejected shells all along this view.In the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Camera</a> (NIRCam) image, the white dwarf appears to the lower left of the bright, central star, partially hidden by a diffraction spike. The same star appears – but brighter, larger, and redder – in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) image. This white dwarf star is cloaked in thick layers of dust, which make it appear larger.The brighter star in both images hasn’t yet shed its layers. It closely orbits the dimmer white dwarf, helping to distribute what it’s ejected.Over thousands of years and before it became a white dwarf, the star periodically ejected mass – the visible shells of material. As if on repeat, it contracted, heated up – and then, unable to push out more material, pulsated. Stellar material was sent in all directions – like a rotating sprinkler – and provided the ingredients for this asymmetrical landscape.Today, the white dwarf is heating up the gas in the inner regions – which appear blue at left and red at right. Both stars are lighting up the outer regions, shown in orange and blue, respectively.The images look very different because NIRCam and MIRI collect different wavelengths of light. NIRCam observes near-infrared light, which is closer to the visible wavelengths our eyes detect. MIRI goes farther into the infrared, picking up mid-infrared wavelengths. The second star appears more clearly in the MIRI image, because this instrument can see the gleaming dust around it.The stars – and their layers of light – steal more attention in the NIRCam image, while dust plays the lead in the MIRI image, specifically dust that is illuminated.Peer at the circular region at the center of both images. Each contains a wobbly, asymmetrical belt of material. This is where two “bowls” that make up the nebula meet. (In this view, the nebula is at a 40-degree angle.) This belt is easier to spot in the MIRI image – look for the yellowish circle – but is also visible in the NIRCam image.The light that travels through the orange dust in the NIRCam image – which looks like spotlights – disappears at longer infrared wavelengths in the MIRI image.In near-infrared light, stars have more prominent <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\" target=\"_self\">diffraction spikes</a> because they are so bright at these wavelengths. In mid-infrared light, diffraction spikes also appear around stars, but they are fainter and smaller (zoom in to spot them).Physics is the reason for the difference in the resolution of these images. NIRCam delivers high-resolution imaging because these wavelengths of light are shorter. MIRI supplies medium-resolution imagery because its wavelengths are longer – the longer the wavelength, the coarser the images are. But both deliver an incredible amount of detail about every object they observe – providing never-before-seen vistas of the universe.For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>&nbsp;<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>",

This white dwarf star is cloaked in thick layers of dust, which make it appear larger.The brighter star in both images hasn’t yet shed its layers. It closely orbits the dimmer white dwarf, helping to distribute what it’s ejected.Over thousands of years and before it became a white dwarf, the star periodically ejected mass – the visible shells of material. As if on repeat, it contracted, heated up – and then, unable to push out more material, pulsated. Stellar material was sent in all directions – like a rotating sprinkler – and provided the ingredients for this asymmetrical landscape.Today, the white dwarf is heating up the gas in the inner regions – which appear blue at left and red at right. Both stars are lighting up the outer regions, shown in orange and blue, respectively.The images look very different because NIRCam and MIRI collect different wavelengths of light. NIRCam observes near-infrared light, which is closer to the visible wavelengths our eyes detect. MIRI goes farther into the infrared, picking up mid-infrared wavelengths. The second star appears more clearly in the MIRI image, because this instrument can see the gleaming dust around it.The stars – and their layers of light – steal more attention in the NIRCam image, while dust plays the lead in the MIRI image, specifically dust that is illuminated.Peer at the circular region at the center of both images. Each contains a wobbly, asymmetrical belt of material. This is where two “bowls” that make up the nebula meet. (In this view, the nebula is at a 40-degree angle.) This belt is easier to spot in the MIRI image – look for the yellowish circle – but is also visible in the NIRCam image.The light that travels through the orange dust in the NIRCam image – which looks like spotlights – disappears at longer infrared wavelengths in the MIRI image.In near-infrared light, stars have more prominent <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\" target=\"_self\">diffraction spikes</a> because they are so bright at these wavelengths. In mid-infrared light, diffraction spikes also appear around stars, but they are fainter and smaller (zoom in to spot them).Physics is the reason for the difference in the resolution of these images. NIRCam delivers high-resolution imaging because these wavelengths of light are shorter. MIRI supplies medium-resolution imagery because its wavelengths are longer – the longer the wavelength, the coarser the images are.

The amount of starlight blocked ranges from about 13,600 parts per million (1.36 percent) to 14,700 parts per million (1.47 percent).Researchers are able to detect and measure the abundances of key gases in a planet’s atmosphere based on the absorption pattern – the locations and heights of peaks on the graph: each gas has a characteristic set of wavelengths that it absorbs. The temperature of the atmosphere can be calculated based in part on the height of the peaks: a hotter planet has taller peaks. Other characteristics, like the presence of haze and clouds, can be inferred based on the overall shape of different portions of the spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray lines extending above and below each data point are error bars that show the uncertainty of each measurement, or the reasonable range of actual possible values.

The difference between the best-fit model shown here and the data simply reflects the additional work to be done in analyzing and interpreting the data and the planet.&nbsp;Although full analysis of the spectrum will take additional time, it is possible to draw a number of preliminary conclusions. The labeled peaks in the spectrum indicate the presence of water vapor. The height of the water peaks, which is less than expected based on previous observations, is evidence for the presence of clouds that suppress the water vapor features. The gradual downward slope of the left side of the spectrum (shorter wavelengths) is indicative of possible haze. The height of the peaks along with other characteristics of the spectrum is used to calculate an atmospheric temperature of about 1350°F (725°C).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most detailed infrared exoplanet transmission spectrum ever collected, the first transmission spectrum that includes wavelengths longer than 1.6 microns with such high resolution and accuracy, and the first to cover the entire wavelength range from 0.6 microns (visible red light) to 2.8 microns (near-infrared) in a single shot.

The combined mass of the galaxies and <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a22a0ad6-591a-4ed5-a769-73fbbb6b295e\" target=\"_self\">dark matter</a> act as a cosmic telescope, creating magnified, contorted, and sometimes mirrored images of individual galaxies.Clear examples of mirroring are found in the prominent orange arcs to the left and right of the brightest cluster galaxy. These are lensed galaxies – each individual galaxy is shown twice in one arc. Webb’s image has fully revealed their bright cores, which are filled with stars, along with orange star clusters along their edges.Not all galaxies in this field are mirrored – some are stretched. Others appear scattered by interactions with other galaxies, leaving trails of stars behind them.Webb has refined the level of detail we can observe throughout this field. Very diffuse galaxies appear like collections of loosely bound dandelion seeds aloft in a breeze. Individual “pods” of star formation practically bloom within some of the most distant galaxies – the clearest, most detailed views of star clusters in the early universe so far.One galaxy speckled with star clusters appears near the bottom end of the bright central star’s vertical diffraction spike – just to the right of a long orange arc. The long, thin ladybug-like galaxy is flecked with pockets of star formation. Draw a line between its “wings” to roughly match up its star clusters, mirrored top to bottom. Because this galaxy is so magnified and its individual star clusters are so crisp, researchers will be able to study it in exquisite detail, which wasn’t previously possible for galaxies this distant.The galaxies in this scene that are farthest away – the tiniest galaxies that are located well behind the cluster – look nothing like the spiral and elliptical galaxies observed in the local universe. They are much clumpier and more irregular. Webb’s highly detailed image may help researchers measure the ages and masses of star clusters within these distant galaxies. This might lead to more accurate models of galaxies that existed at cosmic “spring,” when galaxies were sprouting tiny “buds” of new growth, actively interacting and merging, and had yet to develop into larger spirals. Ultimately, Webb’s upcoming observations will help astronomers better understand how galaxies form and grow in the early universe.<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em>For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>",

The combined mass of the galaxies and <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a22a0ad6-591a-4ed5-a769-73fbbb6b295e\" target=\"_self\">dark matter</a> act as a cosmic telescope, creating magnified, contorted, and sometimes mirrored images of individual galaxies.Clear examples of mirroring are found in the prominent orange arcs to the left and right of the brightest cluster galaxy. These are lensed galaxies – each individual galaxy is shown twice in one arc. Webb’s image has fully revealed their bright cores, which are filled with stars, along with orange star clusters along their edges.Not all galaxies in this field are mirrored – some are stretched. Others appear scattered by interactions with other galaxies, leaving trails of stars behind them.Webb has refined the level of detail we can observe throughout this field. Very diffuse galaxies appear like collections of loosely bound dandelion seeds aloft in a breeze. Individual “pods” of star formation practically bloom within some of the most distant galaxies – the clearest, most detailed views of star clusters in the early universe so far.One galaxy speckled with star clusters appears near the bottom end of the bright central star’s vertical diffraction spike – just to the right of a long orange arc. The long, thin ladybug-like galaxy is flecked with pockets of star formation. Draw a line between its “wings” to roughly match up its star clusters, mirrored top to bottom. Because this galaxy is so magnified and its individual star clusters are so crisp, researchers will be able to study it in exquisite detail, which wasn’t previously possible for galaxies this distant.The galaxies in this scene that are farthest away – the tiniest galaxies that are located well behind the cluster – look nothing like the spiral and elliptical galaxies observed in the local universe. They are much clumpier and more irregular. Webb’s highly detailed image may help researchers measure the ages and masses of star clusters within these distant galaxies. This might lead to more accurate models of galaxies that existed at cosmic “spring,” when galaxies were sprouting tiny “buds” of new growth, actively interacting and merging, and had yet to develop into larger spirals. Ultimately, Webb’s upcoming observations will help astronomers better understand how galaxies form and grow in the early universe.<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em>For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>",

      "caption": "Galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is a technicolor landscape when viewed in mid-infrared light by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Compared to Webb’s near-infrared image at right, the galaxies and stars are awash in new colors.Start by comparing the largest bright blue star. At right, it has very long diffraction spikes, but in mid-infrared at left, its smaller points appear more like a snowflake’s. Find more stars by looking for these telltale – if tiny – spikes. Stars also appear yellow, sometimes with green diffraction spikes.If an object is blue and lacks spikes, it’s a galaxy. These galaxies contain stars, but very little dust. This means that their stars are older – there is less gas and dust available to condense to form new stars. It also means their stars are aging.The red objects in this field are enshrouded in thick layers of dust, and may very well be distant galaxies. Some may be stars, but research is needed to fully identify each object in the mid-infrared image.The prominent arcs at the center of the galaxy cluster, which are galaxies that are stretched and magnified by <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-2572b869-1584-45c0-a18b-0c5ffcf32e57\" target=\"_self\">gravitational lensing</a>, appear blue in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) image at left and orange in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Camera</a> (NIRCam) image at right. These galaxies are older and have much less dust.Galaxies’ sizes in both images offer clues as to how distant they may be – the smaller the object, the more distant it is. In mid-infrared light, galaxies that are closer appear whiter.Among this kaleidoscope of colors in the MIRI image, green is the most tantalizing. Green indicates a galaxy’s dust includes a mix of hydrocarbons and other chemical compounds.The differences in Webb’s images are owed to the technical capabilities of the MIRI and NIRCam instruments. MIRI captures mid-infrared light, which highlights where the dust is. Dust is a major ingredient for star formation. Stars are brighter at shorter wavelengths, which is why they appear with prominent diffraction spikes in the NIRCam image.With Webb’s mid-infrared data, researchers will soon be able to add much more precise calculations of dust quantities in stars and galaxies to their models, and begin to more clearly understand how galaxies at any distance form and change over time.For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>&nbsp;<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>",

The wayward object swung within 24 million miles of the Sun before racing out of the solar system. 'Oumuamua still defies any simple categorization. It did not behave like a comet, and it had a variety of unusual characteristics. As the complex rotation of the object made it difficult to determine the exact shape, there are many models of what it could look like.",

GJ 1214 b, a warm sub-Neptune-sized exoplanet roughly 48 light-years from Earth, is one of the most studied exoplanets in the galaxy. Previous spectroscopic observations indicate that the planet is shrouded in aerosols (clouds or haze), which have thus far made it impossible to determine the composition of gases that make up its thick atmosphere.&nbsp;This illustration is based on our knowledge of the planet and its host star, and predictions about the likely properties of the planet’s atmosphere. Spectroscopic data from Webb will help us better understand the gases and aerosols that make up the planet’s atmosphere.GJ 1214 b is in between Earth and Neptune in terms of size (radius 2.74 times Earth), mass (8.2 times Earth), and density (2.2 times water). It orbits its star at a distance of only 0.015 astronomical unit (1.5% of the distance between Earth and the Sun), completing one orbit in 1.58 Earth-days. The star, GJ 1214, is cool red dwarf star with a radius of just 0.22 times that of the Sun, a mass of just 0.18 times the Sun, and a temperature of just 3,250 kelvins (around 2,975 degrees Celsius), about 2,500 degrees cooler than the Sun.&nbsp;",

This in turn depends on the composition of the atmosphere. (A water steam atmosphere, for example, would transport a very different amount of heat to the night side than an atmosphere dominated by hydrogen.) Researchers will use the mid-infrared phase curve of GJ 1214 b to map the temperature of the planet by longitude, and then use that information to narrow down possible atmospheric characteristics.&nbsp;",

This multiwavelength composite image includes near-infrared light captured by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, and was the sharpest infrared image ever made of the galactic center region when it was <a href=\"https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2009/news-2009-28.html?news=true\" target=\"_blank\">released in 2009</a>. Dynamic flickering flares in the region immediately surrounding the black hole, named Sagittarius A*, have complicated the efforts of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration to create a closer, more detailed image. While the black hole itself does not emit light and so cannot be detected by a telescope, the EHT team is working to capture it by getting a clear image of the hot glowing gas and dust directly surrounding it.NASA’s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in December 2021, will combine Hubble’s resolution with even more infrared light detection. In its first year of science operations, Webb will join with EHT in observing Sagittarius A*, lending its infrared data for comparison to EHT’s radio data, making it easier to determine when bright flares are present, producing a sharper overall image of the region.&nbsp;In the composite image shown here, colors represent different wavelengths of light. Hubble’s near-infrared observations are shown in yellow, revealing hundreds of thousands of stars, stellar nurseries, and heated gas. The deeper infrared observations of NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope are shown in red, revealing even more stars and gas clouds. Light detected by NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory is shown in blue and violet, indicating where gas is heated to millions of degrees by stellar explosions and by outflows from the supermassive black hole.",

This simulated spectrum, which produces a detailed pattern of colors based on the wavelengths of light emitted, helps researchers take inventories of each molecule. This spectrum shows how much of the gasses like methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide exist. Most of the unidentified features are water. Since spectra are teeming with details, they will help astronomers draw conclusions about the system’s contents as planets form.",

NIRCam and NIRISS capture images in the near-infrared, while MIRI captures mid-infrared images. NIRSpec is the only instrument without a camera.<em>Spectrographs</em> spread light out into a spectrum so that the brightness of each individual wavelength can be measured. Webb has a number of different types of spectrographs, each designed for a slightly different purpose. All four of Webb’s instruments have spectrographs.<em>Coronagraphs</em> are opaque disks used to block the bright light of stars in order to detect the much fainter light of planets and debris disks orbiting the star.

NIRSpec is the only one of Webb’s instrument with an MSA, and Webb is the only space telescope with an MSA.An <em>integral field unit</em> (IFU) is a combination of camera and spectrograph used to capture and map spectra across a field of view in order to understand variation over space.

NIRCam is Webb’s primary near-infrared imager, providing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for a wide variety of investigations. Because NIRCam is the only near-infrared instrument with coronagraphic and time-series imaging capabilities, it is crucial for many exoplanet studies. In addition to imaging and spectroscopy, NIRCam is also part of Webb’s wavefront sensing and control system, which detects and corrects for slight irregularities in the shape of the primary mirror or misalignment between mirror segments, giving the telescope the ability to focus clearly on objects near and far. NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.<strong>NIRCam Components</strong> <em>Cameras</em> capture two-dimensional images of regions of space. <em>Spectrographs</em> spread light out into a spectrum so that the brightness of each individual wavelength can be measured. <em>Coronagraphs</em> are opaque disks used to block the bright light of stars in order to detect the much fainter light of planets and debris disks orbiting the star.<strong>NIRCam Wavelength Range</strong> NIRCam is designed to capture light ranging in wavelength from 0.6 microns (visible red) to 5 microns (mid-infrared).<strong>NIRCam Fields of View</strong> An instrument’s field of view is the amount of sky that it can observe at any given point in time. (The actual area that can be observed depends on the distance of the object being observed.) In this graphic, a Hubble Space Telescope image of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) is shown for scale. The image covers an area of 9.6 × 6.6 arcminutes. (The full Moon has a diameter of about 31 arcminutes across the sky.) NIRCam has two main fields of view, each of which covers an area of 2.2 × 2.2 arcminutes. Its coronagraphic field of view is smaller.<strong>NIRCam Imaging Modes</strong> <em>Standard Imaging</em> is the equivalent to basic digital photography and involves capturing pictures of a wide variety of objects and materials in space that emit or reflect infrared light. <em>Coronagraphic Imaging</em> (sometimes called high-contrast imaging) involves using a coronagraph to block the light of a star in order to reveal the much dimmer light of nearby objects, such as exoplanets and debris disks. <em>Time-Series Imaging</em> involves capturing a series of images at regular intervals in order to measure changes over time. Time-series can be used to track changes in the brightness of a star or can be combined with coronagraphic imaging to track the motion of a planet.<strong>NIRCam Spectroscopy Modes</strong> <em>Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy</em> involves capturing the overall spectrum of a wide field of view: a field of stars, part of a nearby galaxy, or many galaxies at once. <em>Time-Series Spectroscopy</em> involves capturing the spectrum of an object or region of space at regular intervals in order to observe how the spectrum changes over time.

The bright central star is hidden behind a mask in the center of the image to enable the detection of the exoplanet, which is 1 million times fainter than 51 Eridani. The exoplanet is on the outskirts of the planetary system 11 billion miles from its star. Its distance is equivalent to a location between the orbits of Neptune and Saturn in our solar system. The 51 Eridani system is 96 light-years from Earth.Webb will probe the planet’s atmosphere at infrared wavelengths astronomers have rarely used to image distant worlds. Webb will also hunt for other distant worlds — possibly down to Saturn-size — on the outskirts of planetary systems that cannot be detected with ground-based telescopes.",

Io is the most volcanically active world in the solar system, thanks to constant flexing brought on by the gravitational push and pull from Jupiter as well as fellow moons Ganymede and Europa. The extreme tidal forces generate a tremendous amount of heat within Io, keeping much of its subsurface crust in liquid form seeking any available escape route to the surface to relieve the pressure. Hundreds of huge volcanoes cover a surface only slightly larger than the Moon, with erupting lava fountains reaching dozens of miles high.",

This orbit allows the telescope to stay in line with the Earth as it moves around the Sun, assisting Webb’s large sunshield in protecting its infrared instruments from the light and heat of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.<br><br><strong>Mirror Size: </strong>Webb’s large, segmented primary mirror gives it unprecedented light-gathering ability. Each of its 18 hexagonal-shaped mirror segments is 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) in diameter. Together they create a surface 6.6 meters (21.7 feet) across, with a collecting area of about 25 square meters. In contrast, the Hubble Space Telescope has a single, circular primary mirror that is 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, with a collecting area of 4.5 square meters.<br><br><strong>Wavelength Range: </strong>Webb detects light wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum from visible red to mid-infrared. Its four instruments provide wavelength coverage from 600 to 28,500 nanometers, or 0.6 to 28.5 microns (1 micron is one millionth of one meter). The infrared part of the spectrum spans from about 0.75 microns to a few hundred microns.",

By comparison, Hubble’s mirror is 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, with a collecting area of a little more than 4.5 square meters (nearly 50 square feet). Mirror size is important because it determines how much light the telescope can collect over a given period of time. A larger mirror can collect light more quickly, and thus detect dimmer or more distant objects (i.e., it has higher sensitivity) and provide clearer, more detailed images and spectra (higher resolution) than a smaller mirror of the same construction.",

In 2014, engineers stacked and unfurled a full-sized test unit of the sunshield for the first time at a cleanroom in the Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems facility in Redondo Beach, CA. The sunshield is about the length of a tennis court, and was folded up like an umbrella around the Webb telescope’s mirrors and instruments during launch. Once it reaches its orbit, the Webb telescope will receive a command from Earth to unfold, and separate the sunshield's five layers into their precisely stacked arrangement with its kite-like shape. The sunshield separates the observatory into a hot, sun-facing side (reaching temperatures close to 230 degrees Fahrenheit), and a cold side (approximately minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit) where the sunlight is blocked from interfering with the sensitive telescope instruments.",
