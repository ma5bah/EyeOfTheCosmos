This collision not only began a new bout of star formation in the region, but also an endearing smile.",

WASP-39 b orbits relatively close to this star, just 0.0486 astronomical units (4,500,000 miles) away. WASP-39 b has a mass 0.28 times Jupiter (0.94 times Saturn) and a diameter 1.3 times greater than Jupiter.WASP-39 b is tidally locked, with one side facing the star at all times. This means the planet has a terminator (a boundary that separates the planet’s dayside and nightside) where there is an eternal sunrise and sunset.By analyzing a transmission spectrum of WASP-39 b from Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph), a technique that studies the exoplanet’s terminator, astronomers confirmed a temperature difference between the morning and evening, with the evening appearing hotter by roughly 300 Fahrenheit degrees (about 200 Celsius degrees). They also found evidence for different cloud cover, with the morning being likely cloudier than the evening.Webb has not captured a direct image of WASP-39 b.",

A new near- and mid-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope, taken to mark its second year of science, shows that their interaction is marked by a faint upside-down U-shaped blue glow.The pair, known jointly as Arp 142, made their first pass between 25 and 75 million years ago — causing “fireworks,” or new star formation, in the Penguin. In the most extreme cases, mergers can cause galaxies to form thousands of new stars per year, for a few million years. For the Penguin, research has shown that about 100 to 200 stars have formed per year.

It includes the farthest one ever <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-4cfac646-5c48-45b7-956a-70caac1af29c\">spectroscopically</a> confirmed, at a redshift of 3.6. Its progenitor star exploded when the universe was only 1.8 billion years old.",

The decrease in brightness during the secondary eclipse is just 110 parts per million, or about 0.011 percent.The temperature of the planet calculated from this observation is about 1,800 kelvins (around 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit), which is significantly lower than would be expected if the planet has no atmosphere or only a thin rock-vapor atmosphere. This relatively low temperature indicates that heat is being distributed from the dayside to the nightside of the planet, possibly by a <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/102/01HWQT20ZQAXZPCWKYGSNC80ND\">volatile-rich atmosphere</a>.",

In general, the hotter an object is, the more mid-infrared light it gives off.Because WASP-43 b orbits so close to its star (about 1.3 million miles, or 0.014 astronomical units), it is tidally locked: One side faces the star at all times, receiving continuous radiation, while the other faces away from the star in permanent darkness. This results in a clear temperature difference between the dayside and nightside. The amount of infrared light detected from the planet is greatest when the hot dayside faces the telescope, just before and after it passes behind the star (a phenomenon known as a secondary eclipse). The planet appears much dimmer in infrared light when the cooler nightside faces the telescope, as it moves across the star (the transit).The exact difference in temperature, however, also depends on factors such as wind speeds and cloud cover. Based on the MIRI observations, WASP-43 b has an average temperature of about 2,280°F (1,250°C) on the dayside and 1,115°F (600°C) on the nightside. This is consistent with strong winds that carry heat around from the dayside to the nightside, and the presence of nightside clouds that prevent heat energy from escaping to space.The temperature maps were made by carefully analyzing the change in temperature as different parts of the planet rotate into and out of view. The research indicates that the hottest point on the planet is not the point that receives the most light from the star (the substellar point, where the star is straight above in the sky). Instead, it is shifted about 7 degrees eastward. (This is why the maps look slightly off-center.) This is a result of strong equatorial winds, which blow at speeds upwards of 5,000 miles per hour, moving the hot air horizontally before it can radiate energy back out to space.",

In general, the hotter an object is, the more mid-infrared light it gives off.Because WASP-43 b orbits so close to its star (about 1.3 million miles, or 0.014 astronomical units), it is tidally locked: One side faces the star at all times, receiving continuous radiation, while the other faces away from the star in permanent darkness. This results in a clear temperature difference between the dayside and nightside. The amount of infrared light detected from the planet is greatest when the hot dayside faces the telescope, just before and after it passes behind the star (a phenomenon known as a secondary eclipse). The planet appears much dimmer in infrared light when the cooler nightside faces the telescope, as it moves across the star (the transit).The exact difference in temperature, however, also depends on factors such as wind speeds and cloud cover. Based on the MIRI observations, WASP-43 b has an average temperature of about 2,280°F (1,250°C) on the dayside and 1,115°F (600°C) on the nightside. This is consistent with strong winds that carry heat around from the dayside to the nightside, and the presence of nightside clouds that prevent heat energy from escaping to space.The temperature maps were made by carefully analyzing the change in temperature as different parts of the planet rotate into and out of view. The research indicates that the hottest point on the planet is not the point that receives the most light from the star (the substellar point, where the star is straight above in the sky). Instead, it is shifted about 7 degrees eastward. (This is why the maps look slightly off-center.) This is a result of strong equatorial winds, which blow at speeds upwards of 5,000 miles per hour, moving the hot air horizontally before it can radiate energy back out to space.",

Webb’s infrared capabilities enabled scientists to peer through curtains of dust and gas that have historically obscured the star formation process.This image from Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument shows M82’s center in an unprecedented level of detail.

      "caption": "A team of astronomers used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to survey the starburst galaxy Messier 82 (M82), which is located 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. M82 hosts a frenzy of star formation, sprouting new stars 10 times faster than the Milky Way galaxy. Webb’s infrared capabilities enabled scientists to peer through curtains of dust and gas that have historically obscured the star formation process.This image from Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument shows M82’s center in an unprecedented level of detail. With Webb’s resolution, astronomers can distinguish small, bright compact sources that are either individual stars or star clusters. Obtaining an accurate count of the stars and clusters that compose M82’s center can help astronomers understand the different phases of star formation and the timelines for each stage.In this image, light at 2.12 microns is colored red, 1.64 microns is green, and 1.40 microns is blue (filters F212N, 164N, and F140M, respectively).",

Plus, researchers around the world continually use the observatory’s data to conduct scientific research. Their efforts contribute to a long and ongoing legacy of scientific discoveries. In summer 2023, staff and researchers shared what it’s like to actively support this space telescope or investigate its data. Not only are there a range of roles and personal backgrounds within the Webb mission, there are also many other active and upcoming telescopes that require similar contributions.Néstor Espinoza, Assistant Astronomer and Mission Scientist for Exoplanet Science at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“I joined STScI two years before Webb launched, and went on to lead a team that helped commission one of its instruments. I also spearheaded the team effort to test the capabilities of Webb to observe <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-6dcd0136-ce7a-4e4b-802c-d9a49fbbb4d0\">exoplanets</a>. I worked with fantastic teams filled with very talented people I knew I could rely on. We calibrated the instrument and solved a lot of problems together. Our initial analysis of the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-032\">first planet we observed with Webb</a> took only a day or two! The observatory made it very easy because it is extremely stable, but I was still shocked by the precision of Webb’s data. Now, we’re routinely seeing clear signatures of carbon dioxide and water in exoplanet atmospheres. Webb is helping us ask so many new questions about exoplanets.”Brett Graham, Senior Software Engineer at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“When Webb launched, I was impressed by the scale and goals of the mission and immediately started looking for a position at STScI. Now, I contribute to Webb by working with a team to revise software that processes Webb’s data. Our goal is for the software to quickly and efficiently pass the data along to scientists. Together, we manage a large number of complex and ever-evolving needs for calibrating and analyzing data from Webb’s instruments. It is an honor to work with a friendly, helpful and professional team of developers, and support astronomers around the world.”Taylor Hutchison, Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:“I study incredibly distant <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-13abd345-ff50-4efa-bc96-6230dd5be87f\">galaxies</a>. During graduate school, I used some of the biggest telescopes on the planet—and in space—to catch their faint light. In 2022, I began using this telescope—and its data are absolutely exquisite! Now, I can look at star formation happening inside galaxies and investigate how stars’ radiation impacts the gas. I have dreamed of researching <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--introduction\">spectroscopic data</a> like these for years and I sometimes still pinch myself to make sure this is real. In addition to analysis, I am also very passionate about creating resources that level the playing field for everyone in astronomy. I want to help protect and uplift astronomy’s most underserved members, and make access to resources and mentorships as easy as possible.”Mike Menzel, Mission Systems Engineer for the James Webb Space Telescope at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:“I’ve been working on the Webb team for about 25 years. Webb is designed to see the farthest objects in the universe. When I saw <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-035\">Webb’s First Deep Field</a>, which took less 12 hours, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Whatever is in the distant universe, Webb will see it!”Brittany Miles, 51 Pegasi b Fellow at the University of Arizona:“I was part of a team that received some of Webb’s earliest data. I knew the telescope offered game-changing information about <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-105\">VHS 1256 b</a>, a giant Jupiter-sized object. We chatted about our findings almost daily. I absolutely loved collaborating with this team and I’m elated I’ll have the opportunity to recreate these moments over the telescope’s lifetime. You do not need to be a ‘genius’ to do science. Science only requires steady work and collaboration. If you are a Black girl or woman, take up space and stick to your values.”Takahiro Morishita, an Assistant Scientist at IPAC-California Institute of Technology:“I’m part of a team that received some of the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-118\">earliest data Webb sent back</a>. I worked with more than 40 team members to reduce the data and submit our paper in only five days. It was the most exciting, and sleep deprived, time in my life. Our team has of a range of experts and we worked together closely to put out the paper so quickly. It’s very exciting to work with folks around the world so closely. The skills used in astronomy vary so much that we have to rely on each other. And having colleagues in different time zones can make continuous work possible, just like a relay race.”Alyssa Pagan, Science Visuals Developer at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“It is a huge honor to be one of the first people to see Webb’s new images. Our team’s goal is to highlight the complex structures of objects in space while simultaneously making aesthetically pleasing images. Raw telescope images initially appear black and white. When I add color, I follow well-established principles of <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made\">astrophotography</a>, assigning bluer colors to shorter wavelengths and redder colors to longer wavelengths. From there, the science informs our team’s decisions about contrast, color separation, and composition. My hope is that Webb’s images generate interest in astronomy and connect us all.”Jane Rigby, Senior Project Scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center:“Webb has exceeded every one of our expectations. For example, Webb observed galaxies that existed in the early universe in just a couple of hours. We knew Webb was going to do that, but we didn’t project it could between lunch and dinner! This is possible because Webb is supported by hundreds of people in a wide range of roles. Teamwork helped us build, test, and commission Webb—and continues to keep it operating around the clock. Science has always been collaborative, but it’s easier to see now. We all have a place in astronomy and STEM fields. My advice: No matter what your passion is, go for it. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t. When you’re puzzling through problem sets with other students, that’s good practice—you will work with teams throughout your career.”Naomi Rowe-Gurney, recent Postdoctoral Researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and current Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Support Officer at the Royal Astronomical Society in London:“While at NASA, I supported researchers who study <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-01e137c1-9995-4074-9063-0ee5d91af357\">our solar system’s</a> planets and moons.

I was shocked at how beautiful Webb’s unprocessed, raw images are. I briefed the writers about what was new and exciting, and supported the image processors who composed the final images. In my current role at the Royal Astronomical Society, I help implement projects that will increase representation and inclusion in astronomy. I am very passionate about making it easier for people from underrepresented backgrounds to get involved in STEM and space. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that you can’t do something.

We set goals for it that are unobtainable by any other telescope. Some of the people who worked on the initial concepts for the telescope retired before it launched. I am lucky that Webb’s operations reasonably match my career. In 2023, I published a paper as the lead author for the first time in years. Know that there is room for everybody in science, no matter which avenue you pursue. Passion is important. Wherever you go you will encounter difficulties, and passion will help you overcome them.”Aaron Yung, recent NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and current Giacconi Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute:“A few centuries back, important scientific discoveries were predominantly made by individual researchers using artisanal instruments. In contrast, modern-day instruments, like the James Webb Space Telescope, are highly sophisticated and demand the combined efforts of large groups of scientists and engineers. These collaborations have allowed me to learn from others who often possess entirely different scientific backgrounds. We work better as a supportive, interconnected team!”Sebastian Zieba, PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany:“We are privileged to be among the first generations of humans to know that there are planets orbiting other stars.

I am also excited about the chance to study the surfaces of planets that are bare rocks. When a planet doesn’t have an atmosphere, we can directly observe its surface. Different types of rocks have unique characteristics that can tell us about a planet’s geological history. Webb is a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity, and gives us a remarkable ability to explore the entire cosmos.”<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/about/people-behind-webb\">Read longer quotes from these contributors.</a>",

      "caption": "This collection of 19 face-on spiral galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope in <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> is at once overwhelming and awe-inspiring.“Webb’s new images are extraordinary,” said Janice Lee, a project scientist for strategic initiatives at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. “They’re mind blowing even for researchers who have studied these same galaxies for decades. Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.”Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\">NIRCam</a> (Near-Infrared Camera) captured millions of stars in these images. Older stars appear blue here, and are clustered at the galaxies’ cores.&nbsp;The telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\">MIRI</a> (Mid-Infrared Instrument) observations highlight glowing dust, showing where it exists around and between stars – appearing in shades of red and orange. Stars that haven’t yet fully formed and are encased in gas and dust appear bright red.Webb’s high-resolution images are the first to show large, spherical shells in the gas and dust in such exquisite detail. These holes may have been created by stars that exploded and carved out giant regions in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-5e7e2388-0eae-4a31-96f7-ad1f8419c9eb\">interstellar material.</a>Another eye-catching detail? Several galaxy cores are awash in pink-and-red diffraction spikes. These are clear signs that these galaxies may have central active supermassive black holes or central star clusters.These spiral galaxies are Webb’s first big batch of contributions to the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, that includes existing images and data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope’s Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). With Webb’s images, researchers can now examine these galaxies in ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio light.Explore side-by-side images of <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-105#section-id-2\">Webb and Hubble’s views of these 19 galaxies</a>.",

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1566 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1566 is 60 million light-years away in the constellation Dorado.",

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, those these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1672 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1672 is 60 million light-years away in the constellation Dorado.",

These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

      "caption": "Face-on spiral galaxy, NGC 2835, is split diagonally in this image: The James Webb Space Telescope’s observations appear at top left, and the Hubble Space Telescope’s on bottom right. Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb’s image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 2835 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 2835 is 35 million light-years away in the constellation Hydra.",

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image.

In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer.

These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 4254 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 4254 is 50 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices.",

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 4303 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 4303 is 55 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.",

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

(Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 4535 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 4535 is 50 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.",

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer.

These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.&nbsp;Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy NGC 7496 above. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 7496 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 7496 is 24 million light-years away in the constellation Grus.",

Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere.

These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

      "caption": "Face-on spiral galaxy, NGC 628, is split diagonally in this image: The James Webb Space Telescope’s observations appear at top left, and the Hubble Space Telescope’s on bottom right. Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 628 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 628 is 32 million light-years away in the constellation Pisces.",

These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere.

These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image.

These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Its images are about the same resolution as Webb’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Bright red <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\">diffraction spikes</a> at a galaxy’s core in a Webb image can be a “calling card” of an active supermassive black hole, as seen in galaxy <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2024/105/01HMC2V0K4TCGD0B8B6BWTSRH8\">NGC 7496</a>. Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1433 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1433 is 46 million light-years away in the constellation Horologium.",

In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy.

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

Not all oversized diffraction spikes at galaxies’ cores are caused by black holes, though. Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue.

Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere.

Sometimes, they appear when a slew of very bright, centrally located star clusters are in the central region of Webb’s image.In Hubble’s images, the galaxies’ cores are not as bright so these spikes are absent. Diffraction spikes only appear when the source is extremely bright and compact.Sometimes, the central region in Webb’s image has a blue glow. This is a marker of high concentrations of older stars. Webb’s infrared observations allow us to see through the gas and dust to identify these older stars. The light these old stars emit are some of the shortest infrared wavelengths in Webb’s images, which is why they are assigned blue. (Read more about how <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/how-are-webbs-full-color-images-made.html#h2-CK-34acc459-f492-4281-bcbc-7a9ca66227ec\">color is precisely applied to Webb’s images</a>.)In comparison, the cores of Hubble’s image may appear yellower, washing the central region in a soft glow and fully obscuring individual points of light. Hazy brown dust lanes may also cover part of this area. In Hubble’s images, older stars are emitting some of the longest wavelengths of visible light Hubble captures, which is why the color assignments are different. (Compare the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4188-Image\">wavelengths of light Hubble and Webb observe</a>.)In Webb’s image, the newly fully formed stars also appear blue along the galaxies’ spiral arms. Those blue stars have blown away the gas and dust that immediately surrounded them. The farther away they are from the core, the more likely stars are to be younger. Orange stars, likely seen in groups in these images, are even younger: They are still encased in their cocoons of gas and dust, allowing them to continue forming.In Hubble’s images, younger stars pop out in blue and purple – and appear almost everywhere. In contrast, the older stars near the center of the galaxy appear yellowish.Look for knots of bright red and orange in Webb’s image. These are especially easy to identify toward the outer edges of the galaxy’s spiral arms. These are regions of star formation, and mid-infrared light highlights the gas and dust that are a huge part of the mix, since they are primary ingredients for stars that are actively forming.In Hubble’s images, star-forming regions are clusters of bright blue and purple, or sometimes red and pink as hot stars energize nearby hydrogen gas.Webb’s image includes distant galaxies that are located well behind the tightly cropped foreground galaxy. Look for bright blue and pink disks, some seen edge-on, like a plate with a central sphere. Redder galaxies are more distant.In Hubble’s view, distant galaxies are often light orange if they are slightly closer. Like in Webb's image, those that are deeper red are also more distant.Galaxy NGC 1512 was observed as part of the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, a large project that includes observations from several space- and ground-based telescopes of many galaxies to help researchers study all phases of the star formation cycle, from the formation of stars within dusty gas clouds to the energy released in the process that creates the intricate structures revealed by Webb’s new images.NGC 1512 is 30 million light-years away in the constellation Horologium.",

Webb and Hubble’s images show a striking contrast, an inverse of darkness and light. Why? Webb’s observations combine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">near- and mid-infrared light</a> and Hubble’s showcase visible and ultraviolet light. Dust absorbs ultraviolet and visible light, and then re-emits it in the infrared. In Webb's images, we see dust glowing in infrared light. In Hubble’s images, dark regions are where starlight is absorbed by dust.The individual Webb and Hubble images are available for download using the links on the left side of this page.In Webb’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red, and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse.In Hubble’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes.

(They did not classify their individual appearances since that would require detailed information from data known as <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--types-of-spectra-and-spectroscopy\">spectra</a>.) Much more analysis of many more distant galaxies is needed to fully determine which galaxy shapes and compositions existed in the early universe.",

This pair of classifications make up approximately 50 to 80% of all distant galaxies they’ve studied so far – a surprise, since these shapes are uncommon nearby.The advances in astronomers’ classifications are owed to Webb’s sensitivity, high-resolution images, and specialization in <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-ba6cd44f-8136-410d-8b61-683de3bf3c81\">infrared light</a>.

Uranus’ dim inner and outer rings are also visible in this image, including the elusive Zeta ring—the extremely faint and diffuse ring closest to the planet.This Webb image also shows 9 of the planet’s 27 moons. They are the blue dots that surround the planet’s rings. Clockwise starting at 2 o’clock, they are: Rosalind, Puck, Belinda, Desdemona, Cressida, Bianca, Portia, Juliet, and Perdita. The orbits of these moons share the 98-degree tilt of their parent planet relative to the plane of the solar system.One day on Uranus is about 17 hours, so the planet’s rotation is relatively quick. This makes it supremely difficult for observatories with a sharp eye like Webb to capture one simple image of the entire planet – storms and other atmospheric features, and the planet’s moons, move visibly within minutes. This image combines several longer and shorter exposures of this dynamic system to correct for those slight changes throughout the observing time.",

Note that the relationship between north and east on the sky (as seen from below) is flipped relative to direction arrows on a map of the ground (as seen from above).The scale bar is labeled in light-years, which is the distance that light travels in one Earth-year. (It takes 0.1 years for light to travel a distance equal to the length of the scale bar.) One light-year is equal to about 5.88 trillion miles or 9.46 trillion kilometers. The field of view shown in this image is approximately 0.5 light-years across and 0.8 light-years high.This image shows invisible near-infrared wavelengths of light that have been translated into visible-light colors. The color key shows which NIRCam filters were used when collecting the light. The color of each filter name is the visible light color used to represent the infrared light that passes through that filter.",

These tiny knots of gas, comprised of sulfur, oxygen, argon, and neon from the star itself, are only detectable by NIRCam’s exquisite resolution, and give researchers a hint at how the dying star shattered like glass when it exploded.The outskirts of the main inner shell looks like smoke from a campfire. This marks where ejected material from the exploded star is ramming into surrounding circumstellar material. Researchers say this white color is light from synchrotron radiation, which is generated by charged particles traveling at extremely high speeds spiraling around magnetic field lines.There are also several light echoes visible in this image, most notably in the bottom right corner.

Once our solar system looked something like this, before planets, moons, and asteroids formed. The raw ingredients, including those for life on Earth, were present in the Sun’s protoplanetary disk.SZ Cha emits radiation in multiple wavelengths which are evaporating the disk. Planets are in a race against time to form before the disk of material is evaporated completely. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope observed typical conditions in the disk – it was being bombarded primarily by X-rays. However, when NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope observed the disk in 2008, it saw a different scene, dominated by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, indicated by the presence of a <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/142/01HEQMET2S7F07C20TDE8X5GNG\">specific type of neon</a> in the disk. These differences are significant because planets would have more time to form from a disk dominated by EUV. Astronomers are investigating the cause of the difference between Webb and Spitzer’s readings, and think it may be due to the presence (or not) of a strong wind that, when active, absorbs EUV, leaving X-rays to hit the disk.&nbsp;<br><br>",

Once our solar system looked something like this, before planets, moons, and asteroids formed. The raw ingredients, including those for life on Earth, were present in the Sun’s protoplanetary disk.SZ Cha emits radiation in multiple wavelengths which are evaporating the disk. Planets are in a race against time to form before the disk of material is evaporated completely. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope observed typical conditions in the disk – it was being bombarded primarily by X-rays. However, when NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope observed the disk in 2008, it saw a different scene, dominated by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, indicated by the presence of a <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/142/01HEQMET2S7F07C20TDE8X5GNG\">specific type of neon</a> in the disk. These differences are significant because planets would have more time to form from a disk dominated by EUV. Astronomers are investigating the cause of the difference between Webb and Spitzer’s readings, and think it may be due to the presence (or not) of a strong wind that, when active, absorbs EUV, leaving X-rays to hit the disk.&nbsp;<br><br>",

In 2008, Spitzer’s detection of significant neon III made SZ Cha an outlier among similar young protoplanetary disks. However, when Webb followed up on SZ Cha in 2023, the ratio of neon II to III was within typical levels.All of this is significant because protoplanetary disks are the stuff of future planetary systems – and those potential planets are in a race against time. Astronomers use neon as an indicator of the dominant radiation hitting the disk and causing it to evaporate. When extreme ultraviolet light is dominant, there is more neon III. That is the unusual circumstance that Spitzer observed in 2008. Typically, a disk is dominated by X-ray radiation, which evaporates the disk more quickly, leaving planets less time to form.Researchers think the dramatic differences in neon detections are the result of a wind that, when present, absorbs ultraviolet light and leaves X-rays to pummel the disk. They will continue using Webb to find other examples of variability in disk conditions, working toward a better understanding of how planetary systems develop around Sun-like stars.",

Both images feature hundreds of galaxies, however the Webb image shows galaxies that are invisible or only barely visible in the Hubble image. This is because Webb’s infrared vision can detect galaxies too distant or dusty for Hubble to see. (Light from distant galaxies is <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a138baf3-5963-4640-a405-aa3552a5152e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">redshifted</a> due to the expansion of the universe.) The total exposure time for Webb was about 22 hours, compared to 122 hours of exposure time for the Hubble image.",

The researchers designed their observations to test whether compact planet-forming disks have more water in their inner regions than extended planet-forming disks with gaps. This would happen if ice-covered pebbles in the compact disks drift more efficiently into the close-in regions nearer to the star and deliver large amounts of solids and water to the just-forming, rocky, inner planets.Current research proposes that large planets may cause rings of increased pressure, where pebbles tend to collect. As the pebbles drift, any time they encounter an increase in pressure, they tend to collect there. These pressure traps don't necessarily shut down pebble drift, but they do impede it. This is what appears to be happening in the large disks with rings and gaps.

Kilonovas—an explosion produced by a neutron star merging with either a black hole or with another neutron star—are extremely rare, making it difficult to observe these events. The highly sensitive infrared capabilities of Webb helped scientists identify the home address of the two neutron stars that created the kilonova.This image from Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument highlights GRB 230307A’s kilonova and its former home galaxy among their local environment of other galaxies and foreground stars. The neutron stars were kicked out of their home galaxy and traveled the distance of about 120,000 light-years, approximately the diameter of the Milky Way galaxy, before finally merging several hundred million years later.",

This discovery has important implications for the potential habitability of Europa’s ocean. The moon appears mostly blue because it is brighter at shorter infrared wavelengths.

Surface ices in these regions have been disrupted, and there likely has been a relatively recent exchange of material between the subsurface ocean and the icy surface.

Look for them at the center of the red diffraction spikes. The stars are buried deeply, appearing as an orange-white splotch. They are surrounded by a disk of gas and dust that continues to add to their mass.Herbig-Haro 46/47 is an important object to study because it is relatively young – only a few thousand years old.

The subject is the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to Earth. It is a relatively small, quiet stellar nursery, but you’d never know it from Webb’s chaotic close-up.

The black hole, within galaxy CEERS 1019, existed just over 570 million years after the big bang and weighs only 9 million solar masses. For context, the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy is 4.6 million times the mass of the Sun, and other very distant supermassive black holes we’ve known about for decades weigh more than 1 billion times the mass of the Sun. (CEERS 1019 may only hold this record for a few weeks – claims about other, more distant black holes identified by Webb are currently being carefully reviewed by the astronomical community.)Though small, CEERS 1019 is ravenous, consuming gas, dust, and stars at the highest theoretically possible rate for its size. Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--introduction\">spectrum</a> reflects it is fully focused on eating its “meal.”Ready to explore the data? Find the white peak just past 4.7 microns. It represents hydrogen. Webb’s data are fitted to two models, because more than one source is responsible for the data’s shape.

The data can also prove that the black hole is emitting a lot of light – and that gas is speeding around the black hole.What Larson appreciates most is how incredibly consistent Webb’s data are. “We have data about this object from all four of the telescope’s instruments and all of its information is telling the same story – that a young, lower mass black hole is present,” she explained.This result is also exciting because of the additional discoveries that may soon be reported. “Detecting smaller active supermassive black holes at the early times in the universe may become a little bit more common than we expected with this telescope,” said Rebecca Larson of the University of Texas at Austin, who led this discovery.Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images/resources/microshutters\">microshutter array</a> aboard <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0T08S2V810Y7ENZMGWTVDA\">NIRSpec</a> (its Near-Infrared Spectrograph) produced the highly detailed spectra above.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

These two are so small that they are closer to the size of <a href=\"https://viewspace.org/interactives/unveiling_invisible_universe/black_holes/sagittarius_a#slider-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sagittarius A*</a>, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, which is 4.6 million times the mass of the Sun. “Researchers have long known that there must be lower mass black holes in the early universe,” explained Dale Kocevski of Colby College in Waterville, Maine, who led this research as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. “But Webb is the first observatory that has captured them so clearly.”Unmistakable signatures of the distances to their host galaxies are in each <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-3fffcbe3-33d4-4b00-80e2-9b7b7bb5d14b\">spectrum</a> above: Three lines appear in the same order – one hydrogen line followed by two ionized oxygen lines. Where this pattern falls reveals the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a138baf3-5963-4640-a405-aa3552a5152e\">redshift</a> of the two targets, showing researchers how long ago their light was emitted.The first spectrum proves black hole CEERS 2782 existed only 1.1 billion years after the big bang, emitting its light 12.7 billion years ago. Webb’s data also show it is clear of dust. The second, CEERS 746, existed slightly earlier, 1 billion years after the big bang, but its bright <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-4cdc440b-71cf-45e8-a6e6-7c76622d19aa\">accretion disk</a> is still partially clouded by dust. “The central black hole is visible, but the presence of dust suggests it might lie within a galaxy that is furiously pumping out stars,” added Kocevski.The researchers found this pair of extremely distant black holes while carefully reviewing images from the CEERS Survey – and followed up to learn their precise makeup with Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images/resources/microshutters\">microshutter array</a> aboard <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0T08S2V810Y7ENZMGWTVDA\">NIRSpec</a> (its Near-Infrared Spectrograph), which produced the definitive spectra above. Webb was immediately able to clearly detail some of the most distant black holes yet known, which has already opened a vast new region of research.These black holes existed toward the end of the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2020/37/4697-Image\">Era of Reionization</a>, when the universe was cast in a dense “fog.” With its <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy\">infrared observations</a>, Webb can capture plenty of light from objects that existed during this period, which is why researchers are so excited to continue reviewing the CEERS data. “We don’t yet know how the earliest black holes formed in the universe,” said Steven Finkelstein of the University of Texas at Austin, who leads this program. “With Webb, we can now start to systematically search for them and begin untangling this mystery.”<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

The large amounts of dust found around these supernovae support the theory that supernovae played a key role in supplying dust to the early universe.SN 2004et is highlighted in the left panel of this image, and SN 2017eaw in the right panel. Webb’s exquisite sensitivity and capability to observe in the mid-infrared allow it to detect the cooler dust that survived the internal shocks reverberating in the aftermath of the dying stars’ explosions. In these images, the bluer colors indicate hotter dust, while red is cooler dust. The hexagonal shape of SN 2004et in Webb’s image is an artifact of the telescope’s mirror and struts — when the bright light of a point source is observed, the light interacts with the sharp edges of the telescope, creating diffraction spikes.The new Webb discovery is the first breakthrough in the study of dust production from supernovae since the detection of newly formed dust in relatively nearby (170,000 light-years) Supernova 1987A.In SN 2004et, researchers using Webb found more than 5,000 Earth masses of dust, rivaling the amount of dust found in SN 1987A. That’s why SN 2004et appears brighter and redder in Webb images. SN 2017eaw is currently hotter, with less dust (bluer in Webb observations), but in 13 years, researchers expect it to appear similar to how SN 2004et does now.In these images, blue, green, and red were assigned to Webb’s MIRI data at 10; 11.3, 12.8, and 15.0; and 18 and 21 microns (F1000W; F1130W, F1280W, and F1500W; and F1800W and F2100W, respectively).<em>MIRI was contributed by NASA and ESA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in partnership with the University of Arizona.</em>",

It is a region where energetic ultraviolet light from the Trapezium Cluster — located off the upper-left corner — interacts with dense molecular clouds. The energy of the stellar radiation is slowly eroding the Orion Bar, and this has a profound effect on the molecules and chemistry in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-166f6913-63e7-46af-88c4-cb8ab4a58787\">protoplanetary disks</a> that have formed around newborn stars here.Within this image lies a young star system known as d203-506, which has a protoplanetary disk. Astronomers used Webb to detect a carbon molecule known as methyl cation in that disk for the first time. That molecule is important because it aids the formation of more complex carbon-based molecules.",

The gas between galaxies was largely opaque to energetic light, making it difficult to observe young galaxies. As stars and young galaxies continued to form and evolve, they began to change the gas around them. Over hundreds of millions of years, the gas converted from neutral, opaque gas to ionized, transparent gas.What allowed the universe to become completely ionized, leading to the “clear” conditions we see in the present-day universe?Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope found that galaxies are overwhelmingly responsible toward the end of this period.

Enceladus, a prime candidate in the search for life elsewhere in our solar system, is a small moon about four percent the size of Earth. New images from Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) have revealed a water vapor plume jetting from the southern pole of Enceladus, extending out more than 20 times the size of the moon itself. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) aboard NIRSpec also provided insights into how the water from Enceladus feeds the rest of its surrounding environment.Enceladus orbits around Saturn in just 33 hours, and as it does, it sprays water and leaves behind a torus—or ‘donut’—of material in its wake. This torus is depicted in the top diagram in light blue.Webb’s IFU is a combination of camera and <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-8bdf5fe3-c6b6-4182-961d-21fc595c84c0\" target=\"_self\">spectrograph</a>. During an IFU observation, the instrument captures an image of the field of view along with individual <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-b6199c5e-9065-4803-891c-6f17deada9a6\" target=\"_self\">spectra</a> of each pixel in the field of view. IFU observations allow astronomers to investigate how properties—composition in this case—vary place to place over a region of space.The unique sensitivity of Webb’s IFU allowed researchers to detect many lines of water originating from the torus around Enceladus and the plume itself. This simultaneous collection of spectra from the plume and the torus has allowed researchers to better understand their close relationship. In this spectrum, the white lines are the data from Webb, and the best-fit models for water emission are overlaid in different colors–purple for the plume, green for the area central to the moon itself, and red for the surrounding torus.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

Enceladus, a prime candidate in the search for life elsewhere in our solar system, is a small moon about four percent the size of Earth. New images from Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) have revealed a water vapor plume jetting from the southern pole of Enceladus, extending out more than 20 times the size of the moon itself. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) aboard NIRSpec also provided insights into how the water from Enceladus feeds the rest of its surrounding environment.Enceladus orbits around Saturn in just 33 hours, and as it does, it sprays water and leaves behind a torus—or ‘donut’—of material in its wake. This torus is depicted in the top diagram in light blue.Webb’s IFU is a combination of camera and <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-8bdf5fe3-c6b6-4182-961d-21fc595c84c0\" target=\"_self\">spectrograph</a>.

IFU observations allow astronomers to investigate how properties—composition in this case—vary place to place over a region of space.The unique sensitivity of Webb’s IFU allowed researchers to detect many lines of water originating from the torus around Enceladus and the plume itself. This simultaneous collection of spectra from the plume and the torus has allowed researchers to better understand their close relationship. In this spectrum, the white lines are the data from Webb, and the best-fit models for water emission are overlaid in different colors–purple for the plume, green for the area central to the moon itself, and red for the surrounding torus.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

It reveals three nested belts extending out to 14 billion miles (23 billion kilometers) from the star. The inner belts – which had never been seen before – were revealed by Webb for the first time.The Hubble Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory, as well as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), have previously taken sharp images of the outermost belt. However, none of them found any structure interior to it.These belts most likely are carved by the gravitational forces produced by unseen planets.",

This marks where ejected material from the exploded star is ramming into surrounding circumstellar material.&nbsp;Interior to this outer shell lie mottled filaments of bright pink studded with clumps and knots. This represents material from the star itself, and likely shines due to a mix of various heavy elements and dust emission. The stellar material can also be seen as fainter wisps near the cavity’s interior.A loop represented in green extends across the right side of the central cavity. Its shape and complexity are unexpected and challenging for scientists to understand.This image combines various filters with the color red assigned to 25.5 microns (F2550W), orange-red to 21 microns (F2100W), orange to 18 microns (F1800W), yellow to 12.8 microns (F1280W), green to 11.3 microns (F1130W), cyan to 10 microns (F1000W), light blue to 7.7 microns (F770W), and blue to 5.6 microns (F560W).

They plotted the light on the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/spectroscopy-101--introduction\" target=\"_self\">spectrum</a> above.First, let’s look for silicate clouds in Webb’s data. Based on observations of many other exoplanets by many telescopes, the researchers know to look for signatures of clouds in particular areas in the spectrum. Signatures of silicates appears before and after 10 microns, a particular wavelength of infrared light.There is likely a layer of very small grain silicate clouds higher up in the atmosphere. These silicates are finer, more like smoke particles, and are responsible for creating the plateau near 10 microns. Somewhat larger grain clouds are likely a bit deeper. Some particles in these clouds may be about the size of small grains of silt.The combined evidence of fluctuations in the planet’s brightness over time and the different cloud layers in the spectrum point to turbulent weather on VHS 1256 b. “These detections reflect that the planet’s cloud patterns change fairly rapidly,” explained Beth Biller of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. If the researchers were to take more, and longer, observations of the planet, they would see the spectrum shape shift as the locations of the clouds move, reflecting that the clouds are rapidly shifting through the planet’s atmosphere during its 22-hour rotation.But these aren’t like clouds high in Earth’s atmosphere. These clouds are hot – akin to the temperature of a candle flame. Earth’s upper atmosphere is thin and would feel extremely cold.The researchers also made extraordinarily clear detections of water, methane and carbon monoxide with Webb, and found evidence of carbon dioxide. It’s too early to tell what this combination of molecules might mean, though, since the data need to be fully modeled. “Webb’s high-resolution data are stressing our existing models,” notes Polychronis Patapis of ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “Existing models can ingest one or two features, but not as many as Webb has shown us of this target.” This is an extraordinarily exciting moment for researchers – it means there is an amazing amount to learn as they revamp models to fit these data.Webb’s observations of VHS 1256 b highlight many of its technical strengths. Not only do its instruments detect a wide range of near- and mid-infrared light, Webb’s position in space means that the telescope can observe more infrared light than is accessible on Earth – and it captures the details in high resolution. (Earth’s atmosphere filters out some near-infrared and all mid-infrared light.) “Webb has effectively doubled the wavelength range that we’re able to capture,” said Brittany Miles of the University of Arizona, the paper’s lead author. “To top that off, we only needed seven hours to capture the spectrum, which is practically overflowing with details.”VHS 1256 b is about 40 light-years away in the constellation Corvus. It orbits not one, but two stars, which are tightly orbiting one another. The planet lies about four times farther from its stars than Pluto is from our Sun. Although a single day on this planet is 22 hours long, it takes 10,000 years to complete a single orbit or year.The planet’s clouds were confirmed with data from the Webb Telescope.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em><em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

Cooler cosmic dust glows at the longer mid-infrared wavelengths, displaying the structure of WR 124’s nebula. The 10 light-years-wide nebula is made of material cast off from the aging star in random ejections, and from dust produced in the ensuing turbulence. This brilliant stage of mass loss precedes the star’s eventual supernova, when nuclear fusion in its core stops and the pressure of gravity causes it to collapse in on itself and then explode. As MIRI demonstrates here, Webb will help astronomers to explore questions that were previously only left to theory – about how much dust stars like this create before exploding in a supernova, and how much of that dust is large enough to survive the blast and go on to serve as building blocks of future stars, planets, and complex molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this image red is assigned to wavelengths of 12.8 and 18 microns (F1280W, F1800W), green to 11.3 microns (F1130W), and blue to 7.7 microns (F770W).",

Cooler cosmic dust glows at the longer mid-infrared wavelengths, displaying the structure of WR 124’s nebula. The 10 light-years-wide nebula is made of material cast off from the aging star in random ejections, and from dust produced in the ensuing turbulence. This brilliant stage of mass loss precedes the star’s eventual supernova, when nuclear fusion in its core stops and the pressure of gravity causes it to collapse in on itself and then explode. As MIRI demonstrates here, Webb will help astronomers to explore questions that were previously only left to theory – about how much dust stars like this create before exploding in a supernova, and how much of that dust is large enough to survive the blast and go on to serve as building blocks of future stars, planets, and complex molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this image red is assigned to wavelengths of 12.8 and 18 microns (F1280W, F1800W), green to 11.3 microns (F1130W), and blue to 7.7 microns (F770W).",

The spiral arms of NGC 7496, one of a total of 19 galaxies targeted for study by the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS) collaboration, are filled with cavernous bubbles and shells overlapping one another in this image from Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). These filaments and hollow cavities are evidence of young stars releasing energy and, in some cases, blowing out the gas and dust of the interstellar medium surrounding them.Until Webb’s high resolution at infrared wavelengths came along, stars at the earliest point of the lifecycle in nearby galaxies like NGC 7496 remained obscured by gas and dust. Webb’s specific wavelength coverage allows for the detection of complex organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which play a critical role in the formation of stars and planets. In Webb’s MIRI image, these are mostly found within the main dust lanes in the spiral arms.&nbsp;In their analysis of the new data from Webb, scientists were able to identify nearly 60 new, embedded cluster candidates in NGC 7496. These newly identified clusters could be among the youngest stars in the entire galaxy.&nbsp;At the center of NGC 7496, a barred spiral galaxy, is an active galactic nucleus (AGN). AGN is another way to refer to an active supermassive black hole that is emitting jets and winds. This glows quite brightly at the center of the Webb image. Additionally, Webb’s extreme sensitivity also picks up various background galaxies, which appear green or red in some instances.NGC 7496 lies over 24 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Grus.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in partnership with the University of Arizona.</em>",

      "caption": "Scientists are getting their first look with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s powerful resolution at how the formation of young stars influences the evolution of nearby galaxies. The spiral arms of NGC 7496, one of a total of 19 galaxies targeted for study by the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS) collaboration, are filled with cavernous bubbles and shells overlapping one another in this image from Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). These filaments and hollow cavities are evidence of young stars releasing energy and, in some cases, blowing out the gas and dust of the interstellar medium surrounding them.Until Webb’s high resolution at infrared wavelengths came along, stars at the earliest point of the lifecycle in nearby galaxies like NGC 7496 remained obscured by gas and dust. Webb’s specific wavelength coverage allows for the detection of complex organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which play a critical role in the formation of stars and planets. In Webb’s MIRI image, these are mostly found within the main dust lanes in the spiral arms.&nbsp;In their analysis of the new data from Webb, scientists were able to identify nearly 60 new, embedded cluster candidates in NGC 7496. These newly identified clusters could be among the youngest stars in the entire galaxy.&nbsp;At the center of NGC 7496, a barred spiral galaxy, is an active galactic nucleus (AGN). AGN is another way to refer to an active supermassive black hole that is emitting jets and winds. This glows quite brightly at the center of the Webb image. Additionally, Webb’s extreme sensitivity also picks up various background galaxies, which appear green or red in some instances.NGC 7496 lies over 24 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Grus.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in partnership with the University of Arizona.</em>",

      "caption": "How do researchers spot a distant planet? By observing the changes in light as it orbits its star.A light curve from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0T08S2V810Y7ENZMGWTVDA\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> (NIRSpec) shows the change in brightness from the LHS 475 star system over time as the planet transited the star on August 31, 2022. This observation was made using NIRSpec’s bright object time-series mode, which uses a grating to spread out light from a single bright object (like the star LHS 475) and measure the brightness of each wavelength of light at set intervals of time. The data show that LHS 475 b is 99% the diameter of Earth and therefore rocky.To capture these data, Webb stared at the LHS 475 star system for almost 3 hours, beginning about 1.5 hours before the transit and ending about 30 minutes after the transit. The transit itself lasted about 40 minutes. The curve shown here includes a total of 1,158 individual brightness measurements – about one every nine seconds.LHS 475 b is a rocky, Earth-sized exoplanet that orbits a red dwarf star roughly 41 light-years away in the constellation Octans. The planet is extremely close to its star, completing one orbit in two Earth-days. The planet’s confirmation was made possible by Webb’s data.The background illustration of LHS 475 b and its star is based on our current understanding of the planet from Webb spectroscopy. Webb has not captured a direct image of the planet or its atmosphere.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>",

As this spectrum shows, Webb did not observe a detectable quantity of any element or molecule. Common signatures in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, for example, would indicate a light, gaseous atmosphere. Those elements were not detected in LHS 475 b’s spectrum.The green line represents a pure methane atmosphere, which is not favored since if methane were present, it would be expected to block more starlight at 3.3 microns. The yellow line represents the best-fit model for a featureless spectrum that contains no evidence of the planet’s atmosphere. This model is representative of a planet that has no atmosphere.The purple line represents a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere and is indistinguishable from a flat line at the current level of precision. An atmosphere made up of pure carbon dioxide is far more difficult to detect, even for Webb’s advanced instruments. “We require very, very precise data to be able to distinguish a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere from no atmosphere at all,” explained Jacob Lustig-Yaeger of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. “A pure carbon dioxide atmosphere may be thin like the one on <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars</a>, making it difficult to detect.”The researchers studying LHS 475 b suggest that an additional, upcoming observation may act as a “tie breaker,” allowing them to identify any presence of carbon dioxide – or any other molecule – or rule everything out and conclude the planet has no atmosphere. Quite simply, additional data are required before a conclusion can be made.This transmission spectrum of the rocky exoplanet LHS 475 b was captured by Webb’s NIRSpec instrument on August 31, 2022. A transmission spectrum is made by comparing starlight filtered through a planet’s atmosphere as it moves in front of the star to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star. Each of the 56 data points on this graph represents the amount of light that the planet blocks from the star at a different wavelength of light. The data would reveal molecules in the planet’s atmosphere by showing that they increase the apparent size of the planet at only specific wavelengths. No such atmospheric features are observed in this spectrum.The gray lines extending above and below each data point are error bars that show the uncertainty of each measurement, or the reasonable range of actual possible values. For a single observation, the error on these measurements is extremely small (30 to 50 parts per million).The observation was made using the NIRSpec bright object time-series mode, which uses a grating to spread out light from a single bright object (like the star LHS 475) and measure the brightness of each wavelength at set intervals of time.LHS 475 b is a rocky exoplanet approximately that same size as Earth.

The team found that the disk was brighter at the shorter or “bluer” wavelength, likely meaning that it contains a lot of fine dust that is more efficient at scattering shorter wavelengths of light.The NIRCam images allowed the researchers to trace the disk, which spans a diameter of 60 astronomical units (5.6 billion miles), as close to the star as 5 astronomical units (460 million miles) – the equivalent of Jupiter’s orbit in our solar system. The images were more detailed and brighter than the team expected, and scientists were able to image the disk closer to the star than expected.",

In the Southern Ring Nebula, the team projects that the straight lines may have been shot out hundreds of years earlier and at greater speeds than those that appear thicker and curvy. It’s possible the second set is a mix of material that slowed, creating less linear shapes.By carefully comparing the appearance and timing of these ejections in the data and simulations, De Marco and her team propose that this is more evidence of the presence of a star with a slightly wider orbit that “stirred the pot” of ejections.This image combines near- and mid-infrared light.

      "caption": "Examine the straight, brightly-lit lines that pierce through the rings of gas and dust around the edges of the Southern Ring Nebula in the Webb Space Telescope’s image. These “spokes” appear to emanate from one or both of the central stars, marking where light streams through holes in the nebula. The holes are evidence of where the dimmer star that created this scene shot out material, creating open pathways for light to flow through.Some of the star’s ejections followed thin, straight lines (second box) through the gas and dust. Other ejections (first box) look bent, curvy, and thicker. Why? A team of researchers, led by Orsola De Marco of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, modeled how these complex structures might have formed.

Let’s hit “rewind” and replay the interactions that might have created the scene!First, it’s important to know that none of these illustrations are properly scaled, and three or as many as four of the stars would be too small and dim to appear in Webb’s image. Second, star 1 and star 2 are the only stars we see in the sixth and final panel above. The remaining “guests” will be known as stars 3, 4, and 5. They are all much less massive – in other words far smaller and dimmer – than stars 1 and 2.The first illustration shows a wider field. Star 1, the most massive of this group of five stars, is the fastest to age and is responsible for creating the planetary nebula. Star 2 very slowly orbits star 1, which is easier to see in the last panel. All is relatively quiet at this stage as they orbit one another, though there is another star on the scene, number 5. It orbits star 1 far more tightly than star 2 does.Cue the action! The second panel zooms way in on the scene – and two other companions appear in view. Star 1 has begun to swell as it ages rapidly, swallowing star 3. Through gravity, star 3 starts to draw in material from star 1 and launches jets in both directions. Star 4 is close by, but not yet interacting.The third panel shows how much star 1 has expanded as it ages. Two companions also enter the mix. Stars 3 and 4 have sent off a series of bipolar jets. As these two stars interact, the jets they sent out are tumbled, which leads to the irregular, wavy edges of the gas and dust ejected by aging star 1. Both companions 3 and 4 are interacting within the gas and dust star 1 has ejected.In panel 4, we zoom out to see more of the scene. Ultraviolet light and a fast, spherical wind from the newly exposed ultra-hot core of star 1 is helping to carve out its previously ejected gas and dust, creating a bubble-like cavity. There is also a leftover disk of material from the previous interactions with star 3. Star 3 is no longer visible, but star 5 is now in view. It has a wider orbit and is drawing “lines” through the ejected gas and dust from star 1 as it orbits, like a knife through a bowl of icing.Now, it’s time to zoom out even wider! At this stage, we’re getting closer to a view of the planetary nebula we see today. The fifth panel shows the same trio – stars 1 and 2 with star 5. Now, to mix it up again: As it orbits, star 5 continues to interact with the ejected gas and dust that slowly travels farther and farther from star 1 into the surrounding space, generating the system of large rings seen in the outer nebula.The sixth panel portrays the scene as we observe it today – by zooming all the way out, we see only stars 1 and 2 in the Southern Ring Nebula.Now that you’re oriented, <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-059\" target=\"_self\">read the full recap of the potential events</a>.",

This is one of the reasons why the region is overflowing with stars – dust is a major ingredient of star formation. When knots of gas and dust with sufficient mass form in the pillars, they begin to collapse under their own gravitational attraction, slowly heat up, and eventually form new stars. Newly formed stars are especially apparent at the edges of the top two pillars – they are practically bursting onto the scene.At the top edge of the second pillar, undulating detail in red hints at even more embedded stars. These are even younger, and are quite active as they form. The lava-like regions capture their periodic ejections. As stars form, they periodically send out supersonic jets that can interact within clouds of material, like these thick pillars of gas and dust. These young stars are estimated to be only a few hundred thousand years old, and will continue to form for millions of years.Almost everything you see in this scene is local.

The star, WASP-39, is fractionally smaller and less massive than the Sun. Because it is so close to its star, WASP-39 b is very hot and is likely to be tidally locked, with one side facing the star at all times.NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s exquisitely sensitive instruments have provided a profile of WASP-39 b’s atmospheric constituents and identified a plethora of contents, including water, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, sodium and potassium.This illustration is based on indirect transit observations from Webb as well as other space- and ground-based telescopes.

This graphic shows four <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/videos/2018/30/1158-Video\" target=\"_self\">transmission spectra</a> from three of Webb’s instruments operated in four instrument modes. All are plotted on a common scale extending from 0.5 to 5.5 microns. This graphic, as well as all four of the component elements, are available for download from the links at the left side of this page.A transmission spectrum is made by comparing starlight filtered through a planet’s atmosphere as it moves in front of the star, to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star. Each of the data points (white circles) on these graphs represents the amount of a specific wavelength of light that is blocked by the planet and absorbed by its atmosphere. Wavelengths that are preferentially absorbed by the atmosphere appear as peaks in the transmission spectrum.The blue line is a best-fit model that takes into account the data, the known properties of WASP-39 b and its star (e.g., size, mass, temperature), and assumed characteristics of the atmosphere. Researchers can vary the parameters in the model – changing unknown characteristics like cloud height in the atmosphere and abundances of various gases – to get a better fit and further understand what the atmosphere is really like.At upper left, data from NIRISS shows fingerprints of potassium (K), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and carbon monoxide (CO). At upper right, data from NIRCam shows a prominent water signature. At lower left, data from NIRSpec indicates water, sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO).

      "caption": "NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s mid-infrared view of the Pillars of Creation strikes a chilling tone. Thousands of stars that exist in this region disappear – and seemingly endless layers of gas and dust become the centerpiece.The detection of dust by Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) is extremely important – dust is a major ingredient for star formation. Many stars are actively forming in these dense blue-gray pillars. When knots of gas and dust with sufficient mass form in these regions, they begin to collapse under their own gravitational attraction, slowly heat up – and eventually form new stars.Although the stars appear missing, they aren’t. Stars typically do not emit much mid-infrared light. Instead, they are easiest to detect in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. In this MIRI view, two types of stars can be identified. The stars at the end of the thick, dusty pillars have recently eroded the material surrounding them. They show up in red because their atmospheres are still enshrouded in cloaks of dust. In contrast, blue tones indicate stars that are older and have shed most of their gas and dust.Mid-infrared light also details dense regions of gas and dust. The red region toward the top, which forms a delicate V shape, is where the dust is both diffuse and cooler. And although it may seem like the scene clears toward the bottom left of this view, the darkest gray areas are where densest and coolest regions of dust lie. Notice that there are many fewer stars and no background galaxies popping into view.Webb’s mid-infrared data will help researchers determine exactly how much dust is in this region – and what it’s made of. These details will make models of the Pillars of Creation far more precise. Over time, we will begin to more clearly understand how stars form and burst out of these dusty clouds over millions of years.Contrast this view with <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-052\" target=\"_self\">Webb’s near-infrared light image</a>.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>",

Thousands of stars that exist in this region disappear – and seemingly endless layers of gas and dust become the centerpiece.The detection of dust by Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) is extremely important – dust is a major ingredient for star formation. Many stars are actively forming in these dense blue-gray pillars. When knots of gas and dust with sufficient mass form in these regions, they begin to collapse under their own gravitational attraction, slowly heat up – and eventually form new stars.Although the stars appear missing, they aren’t. Stars typically do not emit much mid-infrared light. Instead, they are easiest to detect in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. In this MIRI view, two types of stars can be identified. The stars at the end of the thick, dusty pillars have recently eroded the material surrounding them. They show up in red because their atmospheres are still enshrouded in cloaks of dust. In contrast, blue tones indicate stars that are older and have shed most of their gas and dust.Mid-infrared light also details dense regions of gas and dust. The red region toward the top, which forms a delicate V shape, is where the dust is both diffuse and cooler. And although it may seem like the scene clears toward the bottom left of this view, the darkest gray areas are where densest and coolest regions of dust lie. Notice that there are many fewer stars and no background galaxies popping into view.Webb’s mid-infrared data will help researchers determine exactly how much dust is in this region – and what it’s made of. These details will make models of the Pillars of Creation far more precise. Over time, we will begin to more clearly understand how stars form and burst out of these dusty clouds over millions of years.Contrast this view with <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-052\" target=\"_self\">Webb’s near-infrared light image</a>.<em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (the MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>",

This event was the world’s first test of the kinetic impact technique using a spacecraft to deflect an asteroid by modifying its orbit.The Hubble images show ejecta from the impact that appear as rays stretching out from the body of the asteroid. The bolder, fanned-out spike of ejecta to the left of the asteroid is in the general direction from which DART approached. In the Hubble images, astronomers estimate that the brightness of the Didymos system increased by 3 times after impact. They’re also particularly intrigued by how that brightness then held steady, even eight hours after impact.These observations, when combined with data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, will allow scientists to gain knowledge about the nature of the surface of Dimorphos, how much material was ejected by the collision, how fast it was ejected, and the distribution of particle sizes in the expanding dust cloud.Hubble will observe the Didymos-Dimorphos system ten more times over the next three weeks to monitor how the ejecta cloud expands and fades over time.Hubble observations were conducted in one filter, WFC3/UVIS F350LP, and assigned the color blue.",

This is also the first detailed exoplanet transmission spectrum ever captured that covers wavelengths between 3 and 5.5 microns.&nbsp;A <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/videos/2018/30/1158-Video\" target=\"_self\">transmission spectrum</a> is made by comparing starlight filtered through a planet’s atmosphere as it moves in front of the star, to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star. Each of the 95 data points (white circles) on this graph represents the amount of a specific wavelength of light that is blocked by the planet and absorbed by its atmosphere. Wavelengths that are preferentially absorbed by the atmosphere appear as peaks in the transmission spectrum.

The Cartwheel is composed of two rings, a bright inner ring and a colorful outer ring. Both rings expand outward from the center of the collision like shockwaves.However, despite the impact, much of the character of the large, spiral galaxy that existed before the collision remains, including its rotating arms. This leads to the “spokes” that inspired the name of the Cartwheel Galaxy, which are the bright red streaks seen between the inner and outer rings. These brilliant red hues, located not only throughout the Cartwheel, but also the companion spiral galaxy at the top left, are caused by glowing, hydrocarbon-rich dust.In this near- and mid-infrared composite image, MIRI data are colored red while NIRCam data are colored blue, orange, and yellow. Amidst the red swirls of dust, there are many individual blue dots, which represent individual stars or pockets of star formation. NIRCam also defines the difference between the older star populations and dense dust in the core and the younger star populations outside of it.Webb’s observations capture the Cartwheel in a very transitory stage. The form that the Cartwheel Galaxy will eventually take, given these two competing forces, is still a mystery. However, this snapshot provides perspective on what happened to the galaxy in the past and what it will do in the future.<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>",

It contains over 150 million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000 separate image files. The visual grouping of five galaxies was captured by Webb’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam)</a> and <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)</a>.With its powerful, infrared vision and extremely high spatial resolution, Webb shows never-before-seen details in this galaxy group. Sparkling clusters of millions of young stars and starburst regions of fresh star birth grace the image. Sweeping tails of gas, dust and stars are being pulled from several of the galaxies due to gravitational interactions. Most dramatically, Webb’s MIRI instrument captures huge shock waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashes through the cluster. These regions surrounding the central pair of galaxies are shown in the colors red and gold.This composite NIRCam-MIRI image uses two of the three MIRI filters to best show and differentiate the hot dust and structure within the galaxy. MIRI sees a distinct difference in color between the dust in the galaxies versus the shock waves between the interacting galaxies. The image processing specialists at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore opted to highlight that difference by giving MIRI data the distinct yellow and orange colors, in contrast to the blue and white colors assigned to stars at NIRCam’s wavelengths.&nbsp;Together, the five galaxies of Stephan’s Quintet are also known as the Hickson Compact Group 92 (HCG 92). Although called a “quintet,” only four of the galaxies are truly close together and caught up in a cosmic dance. The fifth and leftmost galaxy, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four. NGC 7320 resides 40 million light-years from Earth, while the other four galaxies (NGC 7317, NGC 7318A, NGC 7318B, and NGC 7319) are about 290 million light-years away. This is still fairly close in cosmic terms, compared with more distant galaxies billions of light-years away. Studying these relatively nearby galaxies helps scientists better understand structures seen in a much more distant universe.This proximity provides astronomers a ringside seat for witnessing the merging of and interactions between galaxies that are so crucial to all of galaxy evolution. Rarely do scientists see in so much exquisite detail how interacting galaxies trigger star formation in each other, and how the gas in these galaxies is being disturbed. Stephan’s Quintet is a fantastic “laboratory” for studying these processes fundamental to all galaxies.Tight groups like this may have been more common in the early universe when their superheated, infalling material may have fueled very energetic black holes called quasars.

Atomic hydrogen, in blue and yellow, allows scientists to discover the structure of the outflow. Iron ions, in teal, trace the places where the hot gas is located. Molecular hydrogen, in red, is very cold and dense, and traces both outflowing gas and the reservoir of fuel for the black hole.

Although called a “quintet,” only four of the galaxies are truly close together and caught up in a cosmic dance. The fifth and leftmost galaxy, called NGC 7320, is well in the foreground compared with the other four.&nbsp;Tight groups like this may have been more common in the early universe when their superheated, infalling material may have fueled very energetic black holes called quasars. Even today, the topmost galaxy in the group – NGC 7319 – harbors an <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei\" target=\"_self\">active galactic nucleus</a>, a supermassive black hole 24 million times the mass of the Sun. It is actively pulling in material and puts out light energy equivalent to 40 billion Suns.&nbsp;NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope studied the active galactic nucleus in great detail with the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0T08S2V810Y7ENZMGWTVDA\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec)</a>.

Using IFUs, scientists can measure spatial structures, determine the velocity of those structures, and get a full range of spectral data. Much like medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the IFUs allow scientists to “slice and dice” the information into many images for detailed study.&nbsp;NIRSpec’s IFUs pierced through the shroud of dust to measure the bright emission from outflows of hot gas near the active black hole. The instrument saw the gas near the supermassive black hole in wavelengths never detected before, and it was able to determine its composition.Some of the key emission lines seen by NIRSpec are shown in this image and represent different phases of gas. Atomic hydrogen, in blue and yellow, allows scientists to discover the structure of the outflow. Iron ions, in teal, trace the places where the hot gas is located. Molecular hydrogen, in red, is very cold and dense, and traces both outflowing gas and the reservoir of fuel for the black hole. The bright, active nucleus itself has been removed from these images to better show the structure of the surrounding gas.&nbsp;By using NIRSpec, scientists have gained unprecedented information about the black hole and its outflow. Studying these relatively nearby galaxies helps scientists better understand galaxy evolution in the much more distant universe.<em>NIRSpec was built for the European Space Agency (ESA) by a consortium of European companies led by Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center providing its detector and micro-shutter subsystems.</em>For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>&nbsp;",

This white dwarf star is cloaked in thick layers of dust, which make it appear larger.The brighter star in both images hasn’t yet shed its layers. It closely orbits the dimmer white dwarf, helping to distribute what it’s ejected.Over thousands of years and before it became a white dwarf, the star periodically ejected mass – the visible shells of material. As if on repeat, it contracted, heated up – and then, unable to push out more material, pulsated. Stellar material was sent in all directions – like a rotating sprinkler – and provided the ingredients for this asymmetrical landscape.Today, the white dwarf is heating up the gas in the inner regions – which appear blue at left and red at right. Both stars are lighting up the outer regions, shown in orange and blue, respectively.The images look very different because NIRCam and MIRI collect different wavelengths of light. NIRCam observes near-infrared light, which is closer to the visible wavelengths our eyes detect. MIRI goes farther into the infrared, picking up mid-infrared wavelengths. The second star appears more clearly in the MIRI image, because this instrument can see the gleaming dust around it.The stars – and their layers of light – steal more attention in the NIRCam image, while dust plays the lead in the MIRI image, specifically dust that is illuminated.Peer at the circular region at the center of both images. Each contains a wobbly, asymmetrical belt of material. This is where two “bowls” that make up the nebula meet. (In this view, the nebula is at a 40-degree angle.) This belt is easier to spot in the MIRI image – look for the yellowish circle – but is also visible in the NIRCam image.The light that travels through the orange dust in the NIRCam image – which looks like spotlights – disappears at longer infrared wavelengths in the MIRI image.In near-infrared light, stars have more prominent <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01G529MX46J7AFK61GAMSHKSSN\" target=\"_self\">diffraction spikes</a> because they are so bright at these wavelengths. In mid-infrared light, diffraction spikes also appear around stars, but they are fainter and smaller (zoom in to spot them).Physics is the reason for the difference in the resolution of these images. NIRCam delivers high-resolution imaging because these wavelengths of light are shorter. MIRI supplies medium-resolution imagery because its wavelengths are longer – the longer the wavelength, the coarser the images are.

The amount of starlight blocked ranges from about 13,600 parts per million (1.36 percent) to 14,700 parts per million (1.47 percent).Researchers are able to detect and measure the abundances of key gases in a planet’s atmosphere based on the absorption pattern – the locations and heights of peaks on the graph: each gas has a characteristic set of wavelengths that it absorbs.

Researchers can vary the parameters in the model – changing unknown characteristics like cloud height in the atmosphere and abundances of various gases – to get a better fit and further understand what the atmosphere is really like. The difference between the best-fit model shown here and the data simply reflects the additional work to be done in analyzing and interpreting the data and the planet.&nbsp;Although full analysis of the spectrum will take additional time, it is possible to draw a number of preliminary conclusions. The labeled peaks in the spectrum indicate the presence of water vapor. The height of the water peaks, which is less than expected based on previous observations, is evidence for the presence of clouds that suppress the water vapor features. The gradual downward slope of the left side of the spectrum (shorter wavelengths) is indicative of possible haze. The height of the peaks along with other characteristics of the spectrum is used to calculate an atmospheric temperature of about 1350°F (725°C).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most detailed infrared exoplanet transmission spectrum ever collected, the first transmission spectrum that includes wavelengths longer than 1.6 microns with such high resolution and accuracy, and the first to cover the entire wavelength range from 0.6 microns (visible red light) to 2.8 microns (near-infrared) in a single shot. The speed with which researchers have been able to make confident interpretations of the spectrum is further testament to the quality of the data.&nbsp;The observation was made using NIRISS’s Single-Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode, which involves capturing the spectrum of a single bright object, like the star WASP-96, in a field of view.&nbsp;WASP-96 b is a hot gas giant exoplanet that orbits a Sun-like star roughly 1,150 light-years away, in the constellation Phoenix.

A <a href=\"https://viewspace.org/interactives/unveiling_invisible_universe/detecting_other_worlds/transiting_exoplanet\" target=\"_self\">transit</a> occurs when an orbiting planet moves between the star and the telescope, blocking some of the light from the star. This observation was made using NIRISS’s Single-Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode, which involves capturing the spectrum of a single bright object, like the star WASP-96, in a field of view.&nbsp;To capture these data, Webb stared at the WASP-96 star system for 6 hours 23 minutes, beginning about 2½ hours before the transit and ending about 1½ hours after the transit was complete. The transit itself lasted for just under 2½ hours. The curve includes a total of 280 individual brightness measurements – one every 1.4 minutes.Because the observation was made using a spectrograph, which spreads the light out into hundreds of individual wavelengths, each of the 280 points on the graph represents the combined brightness of thousands of wavelengths of infrared light.The actual dimming caused by the planet is extremely small: The difference between the brightest and dimmest points is less than 1.5 percent. NIRISS is ideally suited for this observation because it has the ability to observe relatively bright targets over time, along with the sensitivity needed to measure such small differences in brightness: In this observation, the instrument was able to measure differences in brightness as small as 0.02 percent.Although the presence, size, mass, and orbit of the planet had already been determined based on previous transit observations, this transit light curve can be used to confirm and refine existing measurements, such as the planet’s diameter, the timing of the transit, and the planet’s orbital properties.&nbsp;WASP-96 b is a hot gas giant exoplanet that orbits a Sun-like star roughly 1,150 light-years away, in the constellation Phoenix. The planet orbits extremely close to its star (less than 1/20th the distance between Earth and the Sun) and completes one orbit in less than 3½ Earth-days. The planet’s discovery, from ground-based observations, was announced in 2014.&nbsp;The background illustration of WASP-96 b and its Sun-like star is based on current understanding of the planet from both NIRISS spectroscopy and previous ground- and space-based observations.

      "caption": "Galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is a technicolor landscape when viewed in mid-infrared light by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Compared to Webb’s near-infrared image at right, the galaxies and stars are awash in new colors.Start by comparing the largest bright blue star. At right, it has very long diffraction spikes, but in mid-infrared at left, its smaller points appear more like a snowflake’s. Find more stars by looking for these telltale – if tiny – spikes. Stars also appear yellow, sometimes with green diffraction spikes.If an object is blue and lacks spikes, it’s a galaxy. These galaxies contain stars, but very little dust. This means that their stars are older – there is less gas and dust available to condense to form new stars. It also means their stars are aging.The red objects in this field are enshrouded in thick layers of dust, and may very well be distant galaxies. Some may be stars, but research is needed to fully identify each object in the mid-infrared image.The prominent arcs at the center of the galaxy cluster, which are galaxies that are stretched and magnified by <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-2572b869-1584-45c0-a18b-0c5ffcf32e57\" target=\"_self\">gravitational lensing</a>, appear blue in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZA5HPXKRKH8Y6PKB10V1\" target=\"_self\">Mid-Infrared Instrument</a> (MIRI) image at left and orange in the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/01FA0SZSEW1TZ51BHG0EGW2EZP\" target=\"_self\">Near-Infrared Camera</a> (NIRCam) image at right. These galaxies are older and have much less dust.Galaxies’ sizes in both images offer clues as to how distant they may be – the smaller the object, the more distant it is. In mid-infrared light, galaxies that are closer appear whiter.Among this kaleidoscope of colors in the MIRI image, green is the most tantalizing. Green indicates a galaxy’s dust includes a mix of hydrocarbons and other chemical compounds.The differences in Webb’s images are owed to the technical capabilities of the MIRI and NIRCam instruments. MIRI captures mid-infrared light, which highlights where the dust is. Dust is a major ingredient for star formation. Stars are brighter at shorter wavelengths, which is why they appear with prominent diffraction spikes in the NIRCam image.With Webb’s mid-infrared data, researchers will soon be able to add much more precise calculations of dust quantities in stars and galaxies to their models, and begin to more clearly understand how galaxies at any distance form and change over time.For a full array of Webb’s first images and spectra, including downloadable files, please visit: <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images\" target=\"_self\">https://webbtelescope.org/news/first-images</a>&nbsp;<em>NIRCam was built by a team at the University of Arizona and Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Technology Center.</em><em>MIRI was contributed by ESA and NASA, with the instrument designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.</em>",

Quick analysis made it immediately clear that several of these galaxies were observed as they existed at very early periods in the history of the universe, which is estimated to be 13.8 billion years old.Look for the same feature highlighted in each spectrum. Three lines appear in the same order every time – one hydrogen line followed by two ionized oxygen lines.

These observations mark the first time these particular emission lines have been seen at such immense distances – and these are only Webb’s initial observations. There may be even more distant galaxies in this image!In these spectra, Webb has also shown us the chemical composition of galaxies in the very early universe for the first time. This was made possible by the telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4201-Image\" target=\"_self\">position in space</a> – far away from Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out some infrared light – and its specialization in gathering high-resolution near-infrared light.And since similar spectra from galaxies at closer distances have long been studied by other space- and ground-based observatories, astronomers already know a lot about the properties of nearby galaxies. Now, astronomers will be able to study and compare spectra from Webb to determine how galaxies have changed over billions of years, dating back to the early universe.With Webb’s data, researchers can now measure each galaxy’s distance, temperature, gas density, and chemical composition. We will soon learn an incredible amount about galaxies that existed all across cosmic time!Want to capture your own spectra with Webb’s microshutter array?

Where this pattern falls on each spectrum tells researchers the <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a138baf3-5963-4640-a405-aa3552a5152e\" target=\"_self\">redshift</a> of individual galaxies, revealing how long ago their light was emitted.Light from the farthest galaxy shown traveled 13.1 billion years before Webb’s mirrors captured it. These observations mark the first time these particular emission lines have been seen at such immense distances – and these are only Webb’s initial observations. There may be even more distant galaxies in this image!In these spectra, Webb has also shown us the chemical composition of galaxies in the very early universe for the first time. This was made possible by the telescope’s <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/4201-Image\" target=\"_self\">position in space</a> – far away from Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out some infrared light – and its specialization in gathering high-resolution near-infrared light.And since similar spectra from galaxies at closer distances have long been studied by other space- and ground-based observatories, astronomers already know a lot about the properties of nearby galaxies. Now, astronomers will be able to study and compare spectra from Webb to determine how galaxies have changed over billions of years, dating back to the early universe.With Webb’s data, researchers can now measure each galaxy’s distance, temperature, gas density, and chemical composition. We will soon learn an incredible amount about galaxies that existed all across cosmic time!Want to capture your own spectra with Webb’s microshutter array?

Radio light observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), represented in yellow, highlights the clouds of cold molecular gas that provide the raw material from which stars form. Data from the Very Large Telescope’s Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument is represented in red and magenta, capturing the impact of young, massive stars on their surrounding gas. Visible light captured by the Hubble Space Telescope highlights dust lanes in gold and very young, hot stars in blue. High-resolution infrared images from the Webb Space Telescope will help researchers identify where stars are forming behind dust and study the earliest stages of star formation in this galaxy.",

Fermi is in low-Earth orbit, just above the bulk of Earth’s atmosphere, which blocks gamma rays. (launched in 2008)The Chandra X-ray Observatory detects X-rays. Chandra orbits Earth high above the atmosphere, which absorbs X-rays. (launched in 1999)The Hubble Space Telescope detects ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. Hubble is in low-Earth orbit, just above the bulk of Earth’s atmosphere, which blocks some wavelengths of ultraviolet and near-infrared light. (launched in 1990)The ground-based Rubin Observatory in Chile is designed to survey ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light that makes it through the atmosphere. (scheduled to begin full science surveys by 2023)Ground-based Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), such as the Giant Magellan Telescope, the European ELT, and the Thirty Meter Telescope, will also detect ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light. (scheduled to begin operations in the late 2020s)The Euclid spacecraft is designed to survey visible and near-infrared light. Euclid will orbit the Sun at Lagrange Point 2 (L2), about one million miles from Earth. (scheduled for launch in 2022)The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will survey visible and near-infrared light. Roman will orbit the Sun at L2. (scheduled for launch in the mid-2020s)The James Webb Space Telescope is sensitive to visible (red) to mid-infrared light. Webb will orbit the Sun at L2.

MIRI was developed through a collaboration between the European Consortium (EC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).<strong>MIRI Components</strong><em> Cameras</em> capture two-dimensional images of regions of space. <em>Spectrographs</em> spread light out into a spectrum so that the brightness of each individual wavelength can be measured. <em>Coronagraphs</em> are opaque disks used to block the bright light of stars in order to detect the much fainter light of planets and debris disks orbiting the star. An <em>integral field unit</em> (IFU) is a combination of camera and spectrograph used to capture and map spectra across a field of view in order to understand variation over space.&nbsp;<strong>MIRI Wavelength Range</strong> MIRI is designed to capture light ranging in wavelength from 4.9 to 28.8 microns (mid-infrared).&nbsp;<strong>MIRI Field of View</strong> An instrument’s field of view is the amount of sky that it can observe at any given point in time. (The actual area that can be observed depends on the distance of the object being observed.) In this graphic, a Hubble Space Telescope image of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) is shown for scale.

Additional technical support was provided by the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre.<strong>NIRISS Components</strong> <em>Cameras</em> capture two-dimensional images of regions of space. <em>Spectrographs</em> spread light out into a spectrum so that the brightness of each individual wavelength can be measured. Webb’s <em>aperture mask</em> is a metal plate with seven hexagonal holes that is placed in front of the detectors to increase the effective resolution of the telescope and capture more detailed images of extremely bright objects.<strong>NIRISS Wavelength Range</strong> NIRISS is designed to capture light ranging in wavelength from 0.6 microns (visible red) to 5 microns (mid-infrared).<strong>NIRISS Field of View</strong> An instrument’s field of view is the amount of sky that it can observe at any given point in time. (The actual area that can be observed depends on the distance of the object being observed.) In this graphic, a Hubble Space Telescope image of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) is shown for scale. The image covers an area of 9.6 × 6.6 arcminutes. (The full Moon has a diameter of about 31 arcminutes across the sky.) NIRISS covers a field of view roughly 2.2 × 2.2 arcminutes.<strong>NIRISS Imaging Modes</strong> <em>Standard Imaging</em> is the equivalent to basic digital photography and involves capturing pictures of a wide variety of objects and materials in space that emit or reflect infrared light. <em>Aperture Mask Interferometry</em> (AMI) involves using an aperture mask to increase the effective resolution of the telescope and capture more detailed images. When the aperture mask is in place, only the light that passes through the holes makes it to the detectors—the rest is blocked. AMI simulates the effect of a telescope array, in which a number of telescopes work together to simulate the light-gathering ability of a single, much larger telescope. AMI is used to separate light of bright objects like stars that are close together in space or on the sky.<strong>NIRISS Spectroscopy Modes</strong> <em>Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy</em> involves capturing the overall spectrum of a wide field of view: a field of stars, part of a nearby galaxy, or many galaxies at once. <em>Single-Object Slitless Spectroscopy</em> involves capturing the spectrum of a single bright object like a star in a field of view.&nbsp;",

Different materials on Earth’s surface have different spectra because they reflect sunlight in different ways. (Human eyes can distinguish between snow, water, vegetation, and soil based on their color, which is a result of the various wavelengths they reflect.) Earth scientists use reflectance spectroscopy to study rocks, soil, ocean water, ice caps, mineral deposits, forests, farmland, dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and even wildlife. Planetary scientists can compare the reflectance spectrum of a distant planet to reflectance spectra of different materials on Earth’s surface to figure out what rocks, minerals, liquids, and ices could be on the planet.",

While the star is moving toward us, its spectrum is blueshifted (top spectrum): All of the wavelengths look compressed and absorption lines appear at shorter (bluer) wavelengths than when the star is not moving toward or away from us (middle spectrum). While the star is moving away from us, the light is redshifted: All of the wavelengths look stretched out and the absorption lines appear at longer (redder) wavelengths (bottom spectrum). Because the change in wavelength is directly related to relative speed, astronomers can use Doppler shift to calculate exactly how fast an object is moving toward or away from us. Astronomers can also track the Doppler shift of a star over time to estimate the mass of the planet orbiting it.",

X-ray observations are used to study gas in clusters of galaxies, material around a black hole, and neutron stars. UV observations are used for investigations of supernova remnants and very hot, energetic stars in stellar nurseries; visible light is used to study planets and the majority of stars; infrared light is used to see through cold dust; study warm gas and dust and cool stars, and detect molecules in the atmospheres of planets and stars. Microwave observations reveal information about cool clouds of gas, gas around newly formed stars, and the cosmic microwave background. Radio wave observations are used to study dense, cold gas, and emissions produced by electrons moving in magnetic fields.",

L2 is one of five Sun-Earth Lagrange points, positions in space where the gravitational pull of the Sun and Earth combine such that small objects in that region have the same orbital period (length of year) as Earth. This makes it possible for Webb to remain in constant communication with Earth.&nbsp;Webb is not located at L2, but instead orbits L2, completing one circuit every 168 days. This \"halo orbit\" around L2 is highly elliptical and is roughly perpendicular to its orbital path around the Sun. The distance between Webb and L2 varies between about 250,000 and 830,000 kilometers (150,000 - 500,000 miles). Because of this <a href=\"https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-observatory-characteristics/jwst-orbit\" target=\"_blank\">complex orbit</a>, Webb's precise distance from Earth varies over time.&nbsp;Sizes and distances in this illustration are not to scale. The actual distance between the Sun and Earth is about 100 times the distance between Earth and L2. The distance between Earth and L1 is almost the same as between Earth and L2. L2 is about four times farther from Earth than the Moon.

      "caption": "The James Webb Space Telescope orbits the Sun near Sun-Earth Lagrange point 2 (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Earth. L2 is one of five Sun-Earth Lagrange points, positions in space where the gravitational pull of the Sun and Earth combine such that small objects in that region have the same orbital period (length of year) as Earth. This makes it possible for Webb to remain in constant communication with Earth.&nbsp;Webb is not located at L2, but instead orbits L2, completing one circuit every 168 days. This \"halo orbit\" around L2 is highly elliptical and is roughly perpendicular to its orbital path around the Sun. The distance between Webb and L2 varies between about 250,000 and 830,000 kilometers (150,000 - 500,000 miles). Because of this <a href=\"https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-observatory-characteristics/jwst-orbit\" target=\"_blank\">complex orbit</a>, Webb's precise distance from Earth varies over time.&nbsp;Sizes and distances in this illustration are not to scale. The actual distance between the Sun and Earth is about 100 times the distance between Earth and L2. The distance between Earth and L1 is almost the same as between Earth and L2. L2 is about four times farther from Earth than the Moon. The long diameter (major axis) of the halo orbit around L2 is around the same as the distance between Earth and L2.&nbsp;<em>Graphic and caption updated: October, 2022</em>",

Nevertheless, scattered light from HR 8799 dominates the image, obscuring the four faint planets.

Sophisticated software processing of the NICMOS data removes most of the scattered starlight to reveal the three planets orbiting HR 8799. Astronomers used this decade-old image to calculate the planets’ orbits.

The color and brightness of both Pluto and Charon have been processed identically to allow direct comparison of their surfaces, and to highlight the similarity between Charon’s polar red terrain and Pluto’s equatorial red terrain. Pluto and Charon are shown with approximately correct relative sizes, but their true separation is not to scale.",

      "caption": "This infographic illustrates the spectrum of electromagnetic energy, specifically highlighting the portions detected by NASA’s Hubble, Spitzer, and Webb space telescopes. The portion of the spectrum labeled “visible,” with the colors of the rainbow, is what humans detect as visible light. Beyond the red end of the visible spectrum, the wavelengths are longer than the human eye can detect. The portion of the spectrum immediately beyond red is called infrared. Humans can feel infrared energy as heat. Each of these telescopes detects portions of the infrared spectrum and astronomers can analyze that data, essentially making the invisible visible. Longer wavelengths like infrared, microwave, and radio waves are able to pass through areas of dense gas clouds and other matter in the universe where shorter wavelengths get trapped. By detecting these longer wavelengths with telescopes, we are able to see things in the universe that we could never see in visible light. The infographic demonstrates how much of the electromagnetic spectrum each of these telescopes covers and also their combined coverage. There are other telescopes that detect other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and together these scientific instruments give us a more complete picture of the universe and how it functions. <br>",

      "caption": "This long-exposure Hubble Space Telescope image of massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 shows some of the faintest and youngest galaxies ever detected in space. Abell 2744, located in the constellation Sculptor, appears in the foreground of this image. It contains several hundred galaxies as they looked 3.5 billion years ago. The immense gravity in Abell 2744 acts as a gravitational lens to warp space and brighten and magnify images of nearly 3,000 distant background galaxies. The more distant galaxies appear as they did longer than 12 billion years ago, not long after the big bang.&nbsp;New research shows that the James Webb Space Telescope could potentially detect the first stars and black holes in the universe, if they are gravitationally lensed by a cluster like Abell 2744. A very precise alignment of the cluster and background star would be needed, so Webb would need to observe a number of clusters repeatedly for the best chance of success.",

By comparison, Hubble’s mirror is 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, with a collecting area of a little more than 4.5 square meters (nearly 50 square feet). Mirror size is important because it determines how much light the telescope can collect over a given period of time. A larger mirror can collect light more quickly, and thus detect dimmer or more distant objects (i.e., it has higher sensitivity) and provide clearer, more detailed images and spectra (higher resolution) than a smaller mirror of the same construction.",
