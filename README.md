### Why We Developed Eye of the Cosmos

- **Engage a Broader Audience with Space Exploration:**
Our goal was to bring the awe of space exploration and the incredible work done by JWST to a broad audience in an engaging and interactive way. Through a mix of scientific informations, visual impact, and musical harmony, we wanted to inspire curiosity about the universe.

- **Educational and Fun Approach:**
The inclusion of games for kids and teens serves the dual purpose of education and entertainment, making learning about JWST and space exploration more approachable for younger audiences. The chatbot avatars and interactive tools encourage active learning, fostering an early interest in STEM fields.

- **Creative Storytelling through Space Discovery:**
We aimed to create a multimedia experience that goes beyond just presenting facts, allowing users to feel the wonder of discovering the universe through JWST’s eyes. By fusing music and visuals, we sought to evoke emotions of vastness, mystery, and discovery, drawing users deeper into the story of space exploration.

- **Pushing the Limits of Technology and User Engagement:**
The integration of 3D modeling, AR experiences (in future updates), and interactive elements like the JWST assembly tool provides users with a hands-on, immersive experience. This interactive format was key to making the project engaging and to representing JWST’s discoveries in an innovative way.

### **How We Addressed the Challenge**

Our challenge was to create a captivating multimedia experience that not only communicates the awe-inspiring discoveries of the JWST but also inspires viewers to explore space through music and visuals. The "Eye of the Cosmos" app delivers on this through:

- **JWST Multimedia Journey**: A striking visual experience fusing real NASA JWST imagery with thematic, atmospheric music, creating a cohesive representation of JWST’s discoveries.
