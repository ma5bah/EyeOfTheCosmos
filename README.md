# Eye of Cosmos

## Overview of Our Project

The "Eye of Cosmos" project, developed by **Team Artemis**, is an immersive, multimedia experience designed to captivate a broad audience by harmonizing the discoveries of the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)** with compelling visuals and evocative music. In addition to providing a visually stunning journey through the cosmos, the project also includes engaging 3D educational games and interactive features to teach users of all ages about JWST and its groundbreaking mission to explore the universe.

Through the fusion of JWST imagery and carefully curated music, "Eye of Cosmos" brings the vastness and mystery of the universe to life while informing and inspiring users to learn more about space exploration.

## Project Details

### **How We Addressed the Challenge**

Our challenge was to create a captivating multimedia experience that not only communicates the awe-inspiring discoveries of the JWST but also inspires viewers to explore space through music and visuals. The "Eye of Cosmos" app delivers on this through:

- **JWST Multimedia Journey**: A striking visual experience fusing real NASA JWST imagery with thematic, atmospheric music, creating a cohesive representation of JWST’s discoveries.
